However, interestingly the number of maximum characters changes depending on the web browser used.The screenshot above demonstrates that due to the font settings in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, it is possible to lose one valuable character which should be taken into consideration when optimizing title tags.A complete general overview of Google’s SERP design changes can be found on here. This Moz article also reveals all minor design changes and changes in the vertical search result sections.Google Search Plus Your World Testing on Google.co.jpThe design change above is not the only thing that happened in the Google SERPs in Japan last month. For one day only, on March 8, Google also tested Search Plus Your World (SPYW) on google.co.jp as a rehearsal run. SPYW has already been introduced on Google.com in the US. When logged in to Google, search results can be set to include personalized G+ results or only “public results”, which won’t include any G+ posts or profiles. In the screenshot below you can see a SERP with a privately shared G+ posting on Google.com with SPYW activated. Several forums and SEO websites in Japan have reported that Google was testing SPYW on google.co.jp for one day on 8 March, 2014. Google Plus postings were listed in the SERP as on the screenshot above and it seems that Google is considering rolling out this feature in other countries as well.Google hasn’t made an official announcement on this so far, but it is probably only a matter of time until Google Plus will be integrated into the daily searches of Google users in Japan and other parts of the world.Tags: Google Japan, Japam SEO, Japan PPCCategory: Japan, PPC Japan, SEO Japan][finish queryFlt cost:12281 ms]],time cost:[12299 ms]

However, interestingly the number of maximum characters changes depending on the web browser used.The screenshot above demonstrates that due to the font settings in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, it is possible to lose one valuable character which should be taken into consideration when optimizing title tags.A complete general overview of Google’s SERP design changes can be found on here. This Moz article also reveals all minor design changes and changes in the vertical search result sections.Google Search Plus Your World Testing on Google.co.jpThe design change above is not the only thing that happened in the Google SERPs in Japan last month. For one day only, on March 8, Google also tested Search Plus Your World (SPYW) on google.co.jp as a rehearsal run. SPYW has already been introduced on Google.com in the US. When logged in to Google, search results can be set to include personalized G+ results or only “public results”, which won’t include any G+ posts or profiles. In the screenshot below you can see a SERP with a privately shared G+ posting on Google.com with SPYW activated. Several forums and SEO websites in Japan have reported that Google was testing SPYW on google.co.jp for one day on 8 March, 2014. Google Plus postings were listed in the SERP as on the screenshot above and it seems that Google is considering rolling out this feature in other countries as well.Google hasn’t made an official announcement on this so far, but it is probably only a matter of time until Google Plus will be integrated into the daily searches of Google users in Japan and other parts of the world.Tags: Google Japan, Japam SEO, Japan PPCCategory: Japan, PPC Japan, SEO Japan][finish queryFlt cost:5304 ms]],time cost:[5404 ms]

Again, Yahoo has copied the “photo carousel” function of Google’s mobile search platform, which allows users to swipe through related searches and Yahoo image search results.The screenshots show Google’s photo carousel on the left and Yahoo’s on the right, and demonstrate only minimal differences in design and functionality.To wrap up, the screenshots above clearly demonstrate that Yahoo’s knowledge graph and photo carousel are obviously copied from Google, but there are still differences in positioning, size, used sources and design between the two platforms after Yahoo Japan’s recent updates.Tags: Japan PPC, Japan SEM, Japan SEO, Yahoo!JapanCategory: Japan, SEO Japan][finish queryFlt cost:4063 ms]],time cost:[4164 ms]
