When some companies now re-do their website, they tend to upgrade to HTML5. HTML5 is becoming more and more popular, as the programmers feel that the old W3C HTML standard does not cater to their real world development needs. In HTML5, there are a lot of new attributes and tags which can be used for SEO as well. I will use couple of blog posts to share The Egg’s SEO standards in HTML5.1. Javascript must be placed in external files, the code must be placed before </head> or </body>.2. CSS must be placed in external files, and the code must be placed before </head> as well as before the JavaScript code.3. Do not use these elements: applet、basefont、center、dir、font、isindex、menu、s、strike、u、xmp.4. Follow xhtml 1.0 standard：1) Use lower case for tag name in all elements.2) There must be a value assigned for tag property, for example:<input checked=”checked”><input readonly=”readonly”><input disabled=”disabled”><option selected=”selected”>3) All the elements should be closed (special attention to p and li)；5. Elements such as meta, link, br, img, input should be closed with a slash at the end (e.g. <br />).All the form elements (such as input、select、textarea, except for button) must define name property.6. Page structure should not rely on Javescript. With Javascript forbidden, the page still be can be displayed normally, for example, user still can see the second level navigations.7. Must claim the DOCTYPE at the top of the page. Page must have html, head and body element. Title element must be included in <head> element. Below is a sample structure of standard HTML5 page<!dotype html><html lang=”zh-ch”><head><meta charset=”utf-8”><title>Page Title</title><link rel=”stylesheet” href=””><script src=””></script></head><body></body></html>In the next article, we will share more practices in HTML5.Tags: HTML5, International, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Global][finish queryFlt cost:4550 ms]],time cost:[4552 ms]

Several forums and SEO websites in Japan have reported that Google was testing SPYW on google.co.jp for one day on 8 March, 2014. Google Plus postings were listed in the SERP as on the screenshot above and it seems that Google is considering rolling out this feature in other countries as well.Google hasn’t made an official announcement on this so far, but it is probably only a matter of time until Google Plus will be integrated into the daily searches of Google users in Japan and other parts of the world.Tags: Google Japan, Japam SEO, Japan PPCCategory: Japan, PPC Japan, SEO Japan][finish queryFlt cost:155 ms]],time cost:[163 ms]

However, interestingly the number of maximum characters changes depending on the web browser used.The screenshot above demonstrates that due to the font settings in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, it is possible to lose one valuable character which should be taken into consideration when optimizing title tags.A complete general overview of Google’s SERP design changes can be found on here. This Moz article also reveals all minor design changes and changes in the vertical search result sections.Google Search Plus Your World Testing on Google.co.jpThe design change above is not the only thing that happened in the Google SERPs in Japan last month. For one day only, on March 8, Google also tested Search Plus Your World (SPYW) on google.co.jp as a rehearsal run. SPYW has already been introduced on Google.com in the US. When logged in to Google, search results can be set to include personalized G+ results or only “public results”, which won’t include any G+ posts or profiles. In the screenshot below you can see a SERP with a privately shared G+ posting on Google.com with SPYW activated.
