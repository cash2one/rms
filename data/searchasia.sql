All three of said commercials can be watched here.With these advertisements, Naver demonstrates an ambition to further expand its already near- monopolistic position in the search engine advertisement market, and expand its reach to SMEs rather than just focusing on the mainstream industries and big brands.

However, interestingly the number of maximum characters changes depending on the web browser used.The screenshot above demonstrates that due to the font settings in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, it is possible to lose one valuable character which should be taken into consideration when optimizing title tags.A complete general overview of Google’s SERP design changes can be found on here. This Moz article also reveals all minor design changes and changes in the vertical search result sections.Google Search Plus Your World Testing on Google.co.jpThe design change above is not the only thing that happened in the Google SERPs in Japan last month. For one day only, on March 8, Google also tested Search Plus Your World (SPYW) on google.co.jp as a rehearsal run. SPYW has already been introduced on Google.com in the US. When logged in to Google, search results can be set to include personalized G+ results or only “public results”, which won’t include any G+ posts or profiles. In the screenshot below you can see a SERP with a privately shared G+ posting on Google.com with SPYW activated. Several forums and SEO websites in Japan have reported that Google was testing SPYW on google.co.jp for one day on 8 March, 2014. Google Plus postings were listed in the SERP as on the screenshot above and it seems that Google is considering rolling out this feature in other countries as well.Google hasn’t made an official announcement on this so far, but it is probably only a matter of time until Google Plus will be integrated into the daily searches of Google users in Japan and other parts of the world.Tags: Google Japan, Japam SEO, Japan PPCCategory: Japan, PPC Japan, SEO Japan','article'),(3504,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/e-commerce-china/qunar-and-ctrip-rumored-to-be-in-merger-talks/','Qunar and CTrip rumored to be in merger talks','','Top Chinese online travel companies Qunar and CTrip have been dominating industry headlines of late.

However said stories are largely speculative and are being reported as “rumors”.Sources suggest that Alibaba initially showed an interest in acquiring CTrip earlier this year. Alibaba is part of what is being dubbed, “The Internet Big Three”, a fold of dominant online players which also includes Baidu and Tencent (this collective is also commonly referred to as BAT).It is therefore not surprising that news of Alibaba’s interest prompted Big Three counterpart, Baidu to initiate negotiations with CTrip via Baidu- owned Qunar, to stunt Alibaba’s attempt to strengthen its travel product offerings.Since this development, Alibaba seems to be out of the running as Qunar is by far the more prominent of the two reported front runners in the race to dominate China’s online travel industry.Said negotiations have not yet materialized officially, and neither of the companies concerned have made public statements on the matter.Regardless of the details of any potential partnership with CTrip that comes to pass, the Chinese online travel industry looks likely to be shaken beyond recognition and monopolized should a merger occur.

Although still towing the line of notorious press censorship in the region, the new platform will allow users to browse a variety of news from one source.Both of the aforementioned sites now redirect users to the new Chinese search platform: www.chinaso.com.The news search engine offers common search mediums such as web, image, video, map and news results.In addition to these traditional methods, it also offers users search on national and local newspapers. This is a clear USP of the search platform as local and national news items are currently largely handled as separate entities, even within the online medium of news delivery.The platform also provides vertical news portals for national, political, local, international and financial news. Again, this juxtaposition of news categorized by either geography, subject classification or political leaning is a huge leap forward within the Chinese market from both a news and a search perspective.ChinaSo’s predecessors, Panguso and Jike search, occupied less than 0.2% of the market share previously, and it is not expected that this search engine will do too much to shake China’s search engine market by challenging regional giants Baidu, 360 and Sogou. That said, Chinaso is a step in the right direction and has a focus on news accessibility and diversity that remains unmatched as it stands.Tags: China News, China PPC, China SEO, ChinaSoCategory: China, PPC China, SEO China','article'),(3513,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/china-online-travel-booking/','China online travel booking - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Qunar and CTrip rumored to be in merger talks Top Chinese online travel companies Qunar and CTrip have been dominating industry headlines of late.

This new update allows users to browse 15 r','Naver has added new functions to its auto suggestions via a new technology dubbed, “entity linking”.This new update allows users to browse 15 results, to which Google’s 5 pale by comparison. In addition to this, additional search suggestions are also provided to users in a second column.This new feature is particularly useful for more ambiguous search terms, such as those with the same keyword but with different search intentions.For instance, the example screenshot below demonstrates the search response from Naver when the term “Moulin Rouge” is searched for.This is a more ambiguous search term as it could refer to either the famous Parisian cabaret, or the movie based around it:Another search that could pose problems due to having multiple potential search intentions is “Facebook”. The user could be looking for several things from this search, be it requiring general information on the social network or searching for the direct link to the social networking site.If the link shown below in green is clicked, the user will be directly referred to the Facebook homepage. This result is demonstrative of Naver’s new autosuggestion tool providing to users the most likely desired destination of their search.Naver’s new autosuggestion tool is not useful just for navigating search intent of the user more accurately, but for providing users with many different new options to glean more information from their search.For example, when using the platform to search for the Fast and Furious movie, it displays several different elements of the film with a short information snippet on the right. This function allows users to directly select the part of the movie they are looking for.A demonstration of this can be seen in the screenshot below.Another similar example is a title of a story for which you can find different kinds of media. For the title searched for here, you can directly see results for the movie, the comic and the TV-broadcast of the release:The main goal of this enhancement is to understand and foresee the user’s search intent and give them exactly the results they are looking for in just one click.Whether adding additional rows and columns into the autosuggest section makes searches simpler or more complicated for users is debatable. After all, Google has a reason for showing only 5 suggestions from a usability point of view.However, considering Korean websites and SERPs are designed in a much ‘busier’ way, whereby a multitude of information is compressed on a single page, stuffing the autosuggest section tool to the platform may prove to be a better, more localized update in terms of perceived usability in the Korean market.The autosuggest function is likely to be further developed in future, potentially also depending on usage data.Tags: Korea PPC, Korea SEM, Korea SEO, NaverCategory: Korea, SEO Korea','article'),(3523,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/korea-sales-revenue-and-traffic/','Korea Sales Revenue and Traffic','','The latest data on traffic and revenue of the main search engines in Korea According to DMC Media’s report released February 3, Naver gained 0.4%','The latest data on traffic and revenue of the main search engines in KoreaAccording to DMC Media’s report released February 3, Naver gained 0.4% overall traffic in 2013.The other two biggest search engines, Daum and Nate lost 2.4% and 21.5% respectively.Numbers for Sales revenue for 2013 look somewhat different.

This time the topic was ‘search engines’ and the list below shows us an interesting overview of the most visited search engines in Japan.The pie charts below will illustrate my point a little bit clearer.These numbers are actually in line with the latest available official numbers on the Japanese search engine market share from 2009, which show a share of around 55% for Yahoo! Japan and 30% for Google.However, these numbers are already three years old and looking at this table with the fresh data, we can see a trend which shows that the relative market share of the Google search properties (google.co.jp and google.com together) is bigger now compared to the numbers three years ago, under the assumption that other competitors have the exact same share as before.The pie charts below will illustrate my point a little bit clearer.Again, these pie charts do NOT represent the accurate market share distribution of the Japanese search engine market, but rather tries to show a trend of the relative popularity between the two biggest players in the Japanese search engine market.I hope that official numbers/studies on the market share are coming soon and will show whether or not I am right with my interpretation, but until then we have to work with the available data we have out there. After all, I think that Donnamedia’s data gives us an interesting insight into the latest development of the search engine market share in Japan in 2012.What do you think about this latest development?

For the last two years, this has been the state of play in the market. However, with the commencement of 3B WAR, Qihoo 360 has come into the public eye as a search engine, although it’s better known as anti-virus software and a browser. What’s more, it has even caught up with Sogou and Soso, achieving the second position of the Chinese search market.On 15 August, 360 Search came out and the “3B War” (360 vs. Baidu) began to appear. As 360 Browser already has many users, 360 Search will use this advantage as its weapon to fight for this war. The first step was to change the default search engine from Google CN to 360 Search, which signaled Qihoo 360’s entry into the “search battlefield”.Whether it’s deliberate or not, this can be taken as 360 Search challenging Baidu and will take some search market share from Baidu. In fact, 360’s market share is growing rapidly, which has exerted pressure on Baidu. You can read about the initial jousting in Baidu’s defence against 360 Search in Daniel’s post.360 Search’s latest reaction is to perform some IE kernel modifications, which causes users to access Baidu products through 360 search in IE and 360 browser, without forced Baidu’s forced redirection.Traffic to Baidu properties referred from 360 Search behaves differently on different browsersTo increase their chances of winning this battle, Baidu even partnered with Tencent, who is the opponent of Qihoo 360 and also of Baidu itself to some extent. Baidu will share their database with Tencent, while Tencent will join the Baidu “Security Alliance” and invest 10 billion to set up a safety fund, which fight against 360 of the safety field in return.This war will impact the search market greatly as Baidu looks to defend its highest market share. If Baidu and 360 Search can compete on algorithm improvements or new ideas to get better search results, this will have a positive impact for the entire search industry for users. Conversely, if they just do underhand little tricks against each other rather than enhance themselves, it will probably have the opposite effect. Users will have to bear the brunt of it for better or worse.3B WAR is still ongoing. What will Qihoo 360 and Baidu do next? Not only their competitors, but also the users are watching what will happen later. We hope that the search engine developers can improve user experience to achieve its own share of growth, rather than simply outwitting opponents. We appeal: healthy competition, better result for end users!Tags: Baidu, China SEO, Qihoo 360, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(3535,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/seo-korea/improve-your-korea-seo-ranking-with-our-naver-cafe-guideline/','Improve Your Korea SEO Ranking with our Naver Cafe Guideline','','When it comes to SEO in Korea, there is no way around Naver.

With its 70% market share, it occupies more of the Korean market than Google does in the US currently. In this post I am going to give a short overview on Naver and show you what is important from an SEO point of view.The SERPs of Naver are not only flooded by paid links but also heavily occupied by social media and user-generated content sites, such as community sites, blogs, microblogs, wikis and Q&As.The ‘web results’ category, which is closest equivalent to Google’s standard results, is only one of many. However, Naver normally favours paid and social categories and shows most of them above the web results. (You can read more about the compilation of the Naver SERP’s in Mike Litson’s post on SEO on Naver.)Results in the social categories are normally completely occupied by posts made on Naver’s own social platforms. Participating in Naver’s social media world is almost mandatory in order to increase your exposure on Naver. However, Naver has never really disclosed any specific information on SEO on its platforms.It is difficult to say with absolute certainty which factors or combinations of factors are most important in order to achieve good rankings. Let me shed some light on this matter by sharing my experience on one of the most important social categories in the Naver SERP: the Naver Café. Anyone registered on Naver can start a café for free in order to build up a community on a topic of his/her interest. The owners of successful cafés with high traffic, engagement and a considerable number of members are often collaborating with companies. Most of the time, coupons and sweepstakes are used in order to promote products or brands.The design of the whole page, including banners, widgets and side bars can easily be customised. Naver demands only one part of the left side for advertisement. Overall, the structure of all cafés is very similar. Customisation is mainly limited to the top banner and internal rules when it comes to memberships and postings.After this really quick introduction the question now is: how can I get a good ranking with the help of Naver Café?From our experience we know that the following nine factors play a major role in getting a high position for a café post on the SERP in the Naver café section:Moreover, an optimisation of Naver Café through these factors from an SEO point of view is very important. Naver Café postings can and do cross-rank in other sections such as Web, Image or Video results as well.The order of these factors is not random, but our attempt to give some initial guidance on their relative importance. I will go into more detail and show how these factors work and their importance for SEO on Naver in my next post.I have also prepared a couple of case studies in order to support these findings. I will share them with you in a future post after explaining all factors in detail – so stay tuned!Tags: Korea, Naver, Naver Cafe, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Korea','article'),(3536,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/social-media-china/china-social-media-light-blogging-in-china/','China Social Media – Light Blogging in China','','An introduction to a number of new light blogging services in China and social networking platforms which are rapidly growing in the largest internet market in the world.','“Light blogging” is becoming a popular trend in 2011 in the development of internet usage in China. Light blogging is a social media service which falls somewhere in between regular blogging and microblogging. Light blogging is lighter than blogging and heavier than microblogging. Light blogging combines the expressive and professional nature of blogging with the convenience and brevity of microblogging.As we know, Tumblr, which launched in 2007, occupies the king position overseas in the Light Blogging segment. At present, China has several Light Blogging service platforms: Diandian, Tuita and Sina Qing.Light blogging – DiandianDiandian launched on 7th April this year. Already it has over 2 million users. Diandian’s navigation is separated by “words” “images” ”music” ”links” and “videos”; in total it has 5 main cateories. The interface is well designed and user friendly. Just like Douban (the largest Chinese website devoted to movies, books, and music reviews and which has a large membership of intellectuals), most of the users of Diandian are white collar workers and university students. Diandian has substantial content, especially literary content. This is a perfect match for Diandian’s target audience promoting publication and dissemination of high-quality content.Light blogging – TuitaTuita is a product of Shanda networking, which became fully open in June, 2011. Tuita is aiming at being China’s Light Blogging site for the rich. As can be seen below, Tuita is divided into 6 navigational parts: “phrases” “images” “articles” “videos” “music” and “reading”. On Tuita, the “phrase” and “article” features are separated. The “phrase” feature can accommodate 460 characters and if there are more than 460 characters users should use the “article” feature. The “reading” feature, like Baidu Wenku, enables you to search and read some books or some chapters of books for free. Light blogging – QingSina launched its light blogging feature, named “Qing”, in May, 2011. When you open the website you can see the words “light blog” alpha on the home page. So far, Qing is in closed testing, therefore in order to enter Qing you should have an invitation code. As shown below, Qing is separated into 4 parts: “blog articles” “images” “videos” and “music”. Qing features are currently simpler than Diandian and Tuita. But Qing has the biggest competitive power in that it is relying on Sina’s existing microblogging platform and user base to grow. Qing inputs Sina microblogging users’ friend resources automatically.Presently, light blogging is in the early stage of development in China; with most of the operators still testing and making improvements. With the further development, the future of blogging, light blogging and microblogging will either be to integrate or otherwise divisions will become clear. Eventually, there will be one or multiple strong light blogs emerge.Tags: Baidu, Baidu Box Microblog, China, Microblogs, Netease, SEO, Sohu, Soso, TencentCategory: Social, Social Media China','article'),(3537,'http://www.searchblog.asia/2014/03/',' March 2014 Archives - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Naver Korea Now Advertising its PPC Search Ads on Cable TV Korea’s biggest search engine, Naver, started to market its search ad platform more aggressively with cable TV commercials.

Again, Yahoo has copied the “photo carousel” function of Google’s mobile search platform, which allows users to swipe through related searches and Yahoo image search results.The screenshots show Google’s photo carousel on the left and Yahoo’s on the right, and demonstrate only minimal differences in design and functionality.To wrap up, the screenshots above clearly demonstrate that Yahoo’s knowledge graph and photo carousel are obviously copied from Google, but there are still differences in positioning, size, used sources and design between the two platforms after Yahoo Japan’s recent updates.Tags: Japan PPC, Japan SEM, Japan SEO, Yahoo!JapanCategory: Japan, SEO Japan','article'),(3611,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/how-chinese-people-search-for-travel-online/','How Chinese People Search for Travel Online','','Baidu Data Center released a report to reveal the online travel search behavior in China in early 2014.

In 2013, the travel related searches peaked on National Day. We can see some other search spurts on Tomb-Sweeping Day and Labour Day.In this report, it also reveals an interesting fact about desktop and mobile search. The travel related search on desktop peaked a day before the public holiday, and the searches that happened on mobile peaked on the day of public holiday.People search for travel on working daysIt’s quite interesting that most travel related searches do not happen on weekends and Friday. Most searches occur from 11:00am to 12:00am, 14:00pm to 17:00pm and in the evening from 21:00pm to 24:00pm.Besides, we are seeing the searches for outbound travel has gradually increased over the past three year.

By December 2013, only 114,000 of the sampled users were still doing the same, representing a drop of over 70%.CNNIC’s 2014 Internet Developer Report we covered in January cited a 9% decrease in usage for microblogging in China, although the study includes both Sina and Tencent Weibo, and is not restricted exclusively to highly active users.Users have fewer reasons to be engaged on Weibo now, as the masses have moved on to the next buzz platform, WeChat. Over the years, the instant messaging app had slowly evolved into an integrated platform with added value features such as blogs, games, voice calls, even e-commerce and online payment.The biggest differentiation it has from Weibo is that all sharing is done directly between friends or in closed groups, giving users an extra level of privacy.The features WeChat boasts in comparison to its predecessor continue to make it a more attractive option to users who are molding and growing used to the plethora of new features continually launched by social media outlets. Weibo should endeavor to catch up with this bandwagon if it is to regain prominence in the Chinese Social Media Market.Recent figures in October 2013 have shown that WeChat currently boasts 600 million users, a clear indicator that in order to remain competitive and relevant in an increasingly fierce market, Social Media Services have to be willing to adapt and channel new app and feature trends to attract and maintain a sufficient user base.Tags: China SNS, WeChat, WeiboCategory: China, Social Media China','article'),(3616,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/mixi-struggling-in-japan-acquisition-through-istyle-announced/','Mixi Struggling in Japan – Acquisition Through istyle Announced','','For those observing the social media landscape in Japan it is very clear that Mixi is struggling to compete.

Mixi was the third most popular search term on Google in 2011 before dropping to 6 in 2012, and 2013 saw the local SNS dropped completely from the top 10 list.The case for Yahoo is almost exactly the same: From 2 in 2011, to 6 in 2012, and 16 in 2013.As mentioned in our June news last year, Mixi was flexing many different methods to survive in the Japanese SNS market, such as exploring the smartphone app market.In another attempt, it has been announced that Mixi will merge with istyle, the online marketing company behind the cosmetics website @cosme, on March 31, 2014.It remains to be seen what this new alliance will bring forth and whether it can stop Mixi’s increasing downward spiral.Tags: istyle, Japan SEM, Japan SEO, Japan SNS, Mixi JapanCategory: Japan, Social Media Japan','article'),(3618,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/2014-korean-search-engine-market-share-update/','2014 Korean Search Engine Market Share Update','','First off, there are no major changes for the market shares of the main players in the Korean search engine market.

However, Google seems to catch up pretty fast and has a much bigger mobile market share of 11% compared to its weaker performance for desktop searches, where it has a mere 2% of the market share.Another KoreanClick report confirms that the number of unique mobile visitors for Google is not far off the two main players.Regarding desktop searches, there seems to be a small movement for the positions four and five as Zum has overtaken Nate for the first time in numbers of unique searches. In December 2013 it recorded 46,217,797 unique searches compared to just 40,989,188 unique searches on Nate in the same period.Zum.com is a web portal site, which started its services two years ago and had always been the smallest player among Naver, Daum and Nate. However, it has experienced slow but consistent growth over the past year and is currently maintaining a negligible market share of a little over 1%.At the current speed it shouldn’t pose a threat to the biggest two players any time soon, but it is working hard to distinguish itself from the other platforms. For example, the platform introduced its own web browser called ‘Swing’, which claims to be the fastest browser in Korea and is specifically adapted to the heavily flash-using Korean online environment.Tags: Korea PPC, Korea SEM, Korea SEOCategory: Korea, PPC Korea, SEO Korea','article'),(3620,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/yahoojapan-releasing-most-searched-keywords-rankings-for-2013/','Yahoo!Japan Releasing Most Searched Keywords Rankings for 2013','','Shortly after we reported Google’s Zeitgeist keyword rankings of 2013 in last month’s Asia News, Yahoo!Japan followed with its own yearly keyword r','Shortly after we reported Google’s Zeitgeist keyword rankings of 2013 in last month’s Asia News, Yahoo!Japan followed with its own yearly keyword rankings.As with every year, these rankings, and the comparison of the rankings between the two biggest search engines, offer a great insight into the different usage of the two search engines and the popularity of certain websites and topics among Japanese people.Here were the top 10 search terms in 2013 on Yahoo!Japan with the Google rankings next to it as a reference:The biggest movements evident from last year’s overall rankings on Yahoo!Japan are for the sixth and eighth positions.The only completely new keyword in the top 10 is “Google Map”, and after two consecutive drops in the last two years, Mixi eventually dropped out of the top 10. For more details on Mixi’s current status in Japan, see the SBA article “Mixi struggling in Japan- acquisition through istyle announced.”When comparing the top 10 results between the two search engines, it seems that Japanese users utilize Yahoo frequently for consuming entertaining content but use Google for more information- directed searches.Tags: Japan PPC, Japan SEO, Mixi, Yahoo!JapanCategory: Japan, SEO Japan','article'),(3622,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/baidu-suspected-to-launch-search-in-thailand-brazil-and-egypt/','Baidu suspected to launch search in Thailand, Brazil and Egypt','','In late January, Baidu attempted to discreetly launch its search products in Thailand, Brazil and Egypt before taking them offline shortly after.

These figures represent an overall increase of 3.7%, however the pace has started to show signs of slowing.During the first half of 2013, China’s Internet penetration witnessed an increase of 2%, while only a 1.7% increase was recorded in the second half of the year.Equipment Usage by New Internet Users in 2013The percentage rate of mobile usage among new Internet users is more marked than that cited in CNNIC’s previous report. In June 2013, over 70% of new internet users used mobile phone devices as their medium of access, in contrast to just 35% of users who favoured desktop access.As we enter the New Year, these figures have fluctuated to 73% mobile Internet users to 29% desktop. Fitting with an obvious trend of portable devices’ increasing appeal to Internet users as their preferred medium of access, laptop new Internet user numbers rose 4% to 17%.Mobile Internet Users and ShareChina’s total mobile Internet user numbers currently sit at 500 million, dominating the nation’s total Internet user base with an 81% share.The first half of 2013 saw a 4% increase of mobile user share, a figure which increased by an additional 2.5% by the end of 2013.CNNIC’s report reviewed 12 months of change, focused not only on the technology mediums users prefer to access the Internet via, but also honing in on user consumption trends.In the table below, we have added data from the last report to provide a 6 month comparison chart:Internet Usage ApplicationsAs was saw in the previous report, group- buying experienced the largest growth, with travel booking following as a close second.At the other end of the spectrum, this data shows that microblogging and social networking have stagnated and even declined somewhat in 2013, while instant messaging remains popular among users.One of the main causes of the decrease has been user loss among the high- end user demographic (high income and education) to instant messaging platforms that offer similar social features, such as WeChat.Search Engine Users and ShareOn the other hand, search has experienced only an 8.5% year-on-year growth in user numbers.Considering the growing Internet penetration, this data indicates that 0.7% less Internet users are using search.Travel Booking Users and ShareNearly 29.3% of all Internet users claimed to have completed an online travel booking transaction by December 2013, compared with only 22.4% in June 2013 and 19.8% in December 2012.The year on year growth for travel booking currently sits at 61.9%, while not as explosive as in 2012 (165.4%), it still demonstrates a positive trend within the industry.Chinese Online Travel Booking Services UtilizationThe data also shows that train booking is the fastest growing of all booking types, as we saw 6 months ago. Flight bookings witnessed a steeper increase in the second half of 2013 in comparison.June represented a low 0.1% growth in the utilization rate of flight booking services, but by the end of the year, this figure has risen to a 3.1% growth rate total. Although this figure sits behind train booking (10.6%), it is still a bigger growth rate than hotel booking at 3% and tour booking at 0.9%.

It therefore makes good business sense for Naver to focus on their more successful and profitable products in the region.This exit is demonstrative of the strength of resident competitors in the Japanese search engine market from portals such as Google and Yahoo. These two websites do not allow for less established search engines to enter the market with any great force.Tags: Japan PPC, Japan SEM, Japan SEO, Naver Japan, Naver Japan withdrawalCategory: Japan, SEO Japan','article'),(3636,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/360-sou-and-sogou-continue-to-climb-in-market-share/','360 Sou and Sogou Continue to Climb in Market Share','','The latest market share data from CNZZ shows that 360 Sou has a 22.14% market share, an increase of 21.39% in October.

We will address some of the key findings in this article, and the f','CNNIC have published a new report analysing the online travel industry in China.We will address some of the key findings in this article, and the fleshed out original article can be found in the original Chinese report for your reference.The number of online travel booking users is currently growing faster than the overall internet population.In June 2013 22.4% of internet users were utilizing online travel booking services, a 2.6% increase on December 2012. This data is representative of a total user population of 132.56 million, over 50% of whom booked air tickets online.Demographically, there are significantly more male users than female, and males were found to be more likely to book on a mobile device.Age-wise, users in the 19-39 bracket are more likely to book online and users between the ages of 19-29 were found to be more likely to book via mobile devices.Financially speaking, domestic travel still dominates the online travel market, enjoying a share of 96.7% of online travel booking users. Of this figure, 18.7% visit Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan, 11.5% visit SE Asia and less than 5% visit Japan or Korea. European travel was purchased by 3.6% of users.With reference to flight booking, online users were found to base their purchase choice on the level of discount and flight schedule times. In contrast, it was found that offline users are more concerned about the airline’s safety rating, punctuality and soft factors like the reputation and service of the airline.The online travel booking market is largely occupied by a duopoly of two companies. With reference to the general online booking market share, CTrip (33.9%) and Qunar (22.1%) vastly dominate the market. Other providers operate less than a 10% market share. Individual airline websites enjoy a miniscule 1.6% of the market share.These figures can be broken down into three main categories based on trip purpose: business, personal and leisure. Most online users were found to book flights for leisure purposes, whereas offline users were found to book for personal or family reasons.The data shows that 26.7% of online users book exclusively for leisure, a higher figure than that of offline users. To add, a lower number of 16.4% of users book for personal reasons and 15.8% of users book flights for business matters, both of these figures sit below offline usage.CTrip is used mostly for business and leisure trips, whereas Qunar is often used for personal travel. Airline websites sit closely behind Taobao Travel in 4th for business trip bookings, and enjoy a loftier placing as 3rd choice for personal and leisure trip bookings online.The report further classified the users into four demographic groups determined by income level. The users were split into two income groups within a middle income sector: a stable (mature) group, and a less mature group with more upward mobility.From this income classification, the data shows that CTrip has the most high income users, while Qunar has more middle- income users, especially those in the upwardly mobile group.Therefore the findings of CNNIC’s comprehensive report suggest that Qunar’s user base has significant potential for the future.

The total number of mobile internet users now sits at 464 million, covering 78.5% of the total internet user base.Mobile Internet Users and ShareTaking a closer look at usage, the report examined the 6 months change on various internet applications:Internet Usage ApplicationsCompared with other applications, group buying has experienced the biggest increase, as 17.1% of all internet users have identified themselves as having conducted qualifying transactions in the last 6 months, a marked increase of 21.2%.Online travel booking took second place, with a solid 18.7% increase over the six month period, but has slowed down somewhat in comparison to the last report’s astonishing 165.4% YoY increase.Chinese Online Travel Booking Services UtilizationClose examination of the different types of travel booking activities suggests that the biggest change is in train booking, with hotel booking experiencing a slight increase.

Now it’s time to talk about Baidu Tongji, a screenshot of which is provided below. When used with Baidu’s other products, including Baidu Index, Baidu Trends, and Baidu Data Center, Baidu Tongji can add a lot of value to webmasters, SEO practitioners and managers.Baidu Indexation checkThough we can use the command site:www.example.com to find out the number of pages indexed by Baidu, the number is not accurate. Furthermore, the “site” command doesn’t work with sub-directories; for example when you search site:www.example.com/abc on Baidu, it provides you with the feedback “wrong command”. But by installing Baidu Tongji, webmasters can easily find out the exact indexation numbers for the domain, sub-domains or subdirectories by clicking on the button as indicated below.Keyword Suggestions and Search VolumeWhen integrated with Baidu Index, Baidu Tongji provides keyword search volumes and keyword suggestions on the same interface along with keyword search performance. This gives webmasters and SEO’s a clear direction if there is still room for the keyword landing page to improve, and what other keywords they can create content and optimize for.Conversion AnalysisThe major advantage Baidu Tonji has over CNZZ is that it adds Conversions as a metric, and makes it much more advanced than purely a Statistics Tool, by providing webmasters with an insight beyond Traffic and Page Views.But only one tab, called Conversion Path, under the section called Web Analysis on Baidu Tongji reports conversions. This is nothing compared with Google Analytics, as GA gives Target (Conversions) the same importance as visitors, traffic sources and content, and under its Target (Conversions) section there are 7 tabs analyzing different metrics. Understanding conversions is crucial for many sites including, in particular, eCommerce sites. Without enhanced segmented conversion metrics, I do not believe at this stage Baidu Tongji will be widely utilized eCommerce site owners. However, no doubt Baidu still has plans to continually improve on Baidu Tongji.Some advantages of Baidu Tongji over GA for the China Market Despite some of the shortfalls Baidu Tongji has when compared with GA, there are still many positives which do have certain advantages over GA.For example, Baidu Tongji does provide very detailed information on the segmentation of Chinese localization and allows you to choose to segment your website’s visits by province or area within China, thereby enabling you to analyze visits coming from different regions within China.Furthermore, Baidu Tongji offers useful databases including information on the IP base for Chinese cities and statistics based on the most used browsers or ISPs in China.Finally, Baidu Tongji provides more information than GA on a micro scale of website visitors’ activities including information on the last 500 visitor records and detailed visitor tracks throughout your website for individual visitors which is an interesting and useful analytics feature for SEO managers dealing with the China market.Tags: Analytics, Baidu, Baidu Tongji, China, CNZZCategory: Analytics, Analytics China','article'),(3672,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/kun-tang/','Kun Tang - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' How Baidu and Weibo Rank Weibo Feeds Differently The level of noise surrounding China Search Social integration recently got amplified after Baidu improved the indexation scale of Sina Weibo feeds.

Suning and Amazon round of the top 5, with another electrical retailer Gome also appearing in the top 10.With everyone else jostling for position within the remaining 25%, it’s quite eye opening to see the dominance that Tmall has in the entire commerce industry. China Internet Watch goes on to stress that this year will see fierce competition over what the best e-commerce platform will be.From what we can see, there’s an increasing number of clients who are looking towards Tmall and using their platform to reach out to more customers.

With significantly increasing numbers of users, comments about Meilishuo.com are also growing rapidly on various industry websites. Some commentaries have said meilishuo.com and mogujie.com have created a precedent for community-based e-commerce in China. So, what does meilishuo.com look like?IntroductionMeilishuo.com was founded in November 2009, specializing in women’s fashion. It helps middle class women to find the ideal clothing and skin care products which are best suited to them. Users can search for experts, shops, group buying, and they can also share online shopping links and information on their favorite products. The products listed on Meilishuo.com come from third party websites, and primarily have listings on Taobao, China’s largest e-commerce site. When users click on a product on Meilishuo, they are re-directed to the third party sites, including Taobao, where they can make their purchase and after which Meilishuo will receive a commission.Current StateAccording to Meilishuo.com, the number of registered users has reached 150 million since its launch in March 2010. The daily user volume is 3.2 million while the daily number of page views is 164 million, and per user traffic is averaged at 51 pages. Every month, the website brings about 700 million yuan to Taobao’s turnover.The following chart provides a screen shot of the Alexa open data platform which has analyzed meilishuo.com. The chart shows the daily traffic rank trend of meilishuo.com, which shows a significant upward trend.Profit ModelsMeilishuo.com is a social e-commerce sharing model. In this vertical field, people who have the same interests and hobbies (i.e. finding out about the latest in fashion and shopping for clothes) come together to recommend, share and comment on the many different products which are available. As mentioned above, these products come from third party websites. If people visit meilishuo.com and then buy products on the third party websites like Taobao, meilishuo.com will get a commission. In simple terms, meilishuo.com is a shopping guide entrance – letting people know what the latest fashion trends are /what to buy/ how to mix and match etc.. It does this through good design and layout, which helps to stimulate user interest in buying, and then lead them to Taobao. Meilishuo.com claim their orientation is social e-commerce and their main profits come from advertisements. In addition, group buying also brings significant profits.I think the shortcomings of meilishuo.com are that the product styles are limited to those offered on Taobao, and that the site can even be said to be overly dependent on Taobao. Secondly, it’s difficult to control how Taobao sellers’ self-promote their products on the site. This will bring bad user experiences if the Taobao listings are not up to standard.Promotion modelsFor most of its website promotion, meilishuo.com uses various means to promote online including a huge investment in advertising; traditional search engine optimization strategies; social media platforms (especially Weibo); QQ interconnections and so on. At the same time meilishuo.com has also pursued Mobile App’s to promote on the mobile internet. Now users can enter the site via IPAD / IPHONE and ANDORID ports as well.Meilishuo.com is also focusing on co-operation with QQ interconnection as mentioned above. QQ interconnection is a new function of Tencent, which is similar to Weibo interconnection. Website owners can apply to have the “QQ interconnection” login placed on their sites, so that when users visit their sites, they can use their QQ account to login to the website (with no need to create a new account) which is beneficial for the website owner who can know more about their users. So if users access Meilishuo through QQ interconnection, when they find a good dress, they can click “share”- and then the dress information will be posted on their QQ-zone (which means their QQ blog). “Like” functions are also available through QQ interconnection.When comparing the traffic from QQ interconnection and search engines, iResearch found that the relationship between the two is one to one. After accessing QQ interconnection, the total traffic and number of users of meilishuo.com increased 20% and 70%. In other words, utilizing QQ interconnection for attracting traffic is a win-win promotion method to both Meilishuo and Tencent.Tags: China, E-Commerce, Meilishuo.com, Social MediaCategory: E-commerce, E-commerce China, SEO, SEO China, Social, Social Media China','article'),(3683,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/monique-li/','Monique Li - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Meilishuo.com – a popular social shopping website Meilishuo.com is a very popular fashion e-commerce site in China.

Obviously the setback from 360Buy won’t stop eTao from gaining popularity among both online shops and shoppers, hence the question for small and medium eCommerce sites is how to get their pages indexed by eTao and manage the indexation ASAP.Here in below are the steps to get your site indexed by eTao.1. Develop Feed FileLike the importance of Sitmap.xml for Google optimization, feed files that include Index file, Item file and SellerCarts file are critical for eTao indexation. The index files include FullIndex and IncrementIndex. FullIndex happens every 24 hours, when old data gets cleared out and new merchandise data is uploaded. This is to ensure the eTao index is aligned with merchandise information the eCommerce sites have. IncrementIndex happens every 30 minutes to delete and upload some of merchandise data. This is to ensure some products sold out won’t appear in eTao SERP (Search Engine Result Page) and provide bad user experience.Because of the large number amount of merchandise, feed files should be generated as script files either via PHP or Java version XML generator. (For detailed feed file development instructions see here). The feed files example may look like the picture below.When files are ready, add them in the root directory of your eCommerce site server and use the permanent address www.example.com/taobao/IncrementIndex.xml to eTao as feed interface.2. Submit Feed FileOnce you receive the confirmation email from eTao, log into open.etao.com/my with your account and password received from the email. Then click on the button Submit Raw Data (提交数据源) to get to the interface showing the following picture.Then click on IncrementIndex Setup and FullIndex Setup to finish the indexation setup. Once that is done, it will tell you how much of your merchandise has been indexed by eTao.3. Feed Adjustment/ Indexation ManagementLike Google Webmaster Tools, eTao also tells you what link errors your site may have. Click on the Abnormal Feed (异常Feed) button, where you will find the details of link errors, as the picture below indicates.You can choose to fix any link errors by clicking on the button entitled Eliminate. After that your site is ready and you may apply to get it live.Tags: 360Buy, Amazon, Bestbuy, China, E-Commerce, eTao, WalmartCategory: E-commerce, E-commerce China','article'),(3688,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/360buy/','360Buy - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Guide to Submit eCommerce Website to eTao and Manage Indexation Though 360Buy has blocked the eTao spider from crawling its pages, most eCommerce websites, like I predicted, wouldn’t follow, as recently the eTao SERP is displaying results from Amazon, Walmart and Bestbuy.

Not to be confused','If you have ever searched around for literature about the state of China’s internet, sooner or later, you will read about Sina Weibo. Not to be confused with Tencent Weibo (and the rest of them), Sina’s version has regularly been touted as one of the driving forces of the Internet world here. According to their own figures, there are around 503 million registered users on the micro-blogging platform.However, a recent study from Hong Kong University suggests that only 43% of those are actually active. The Wall Street Journal tells us that the researchers studied approximately 30,000 users, and found that 57% of accounts had no posts in their timelines. That makes for a lot of lurkers, or fake accounts.The study went on to look at user behaviour over a seven day period. Results were just as surprising, with the researchers declaring that 86.9% of users wrote no original posts and 88.9% did not repost anybody else’s posts. These figures don’t exactly paint Sina Weibo as the rich and busy arena of frantic discussion from China’s netizens.Interpretation of these new findings will obviously differ from person to person. Being one of the most powerful vehicles of online chatter, Sina Weibo is unlikely to lose its lustre, and many brands and marketers will continue to turn to it to reach out to an increasingly savvy audience. Despite there being just 43% of active users, that still leaves a raw total of 216 million – that’s more than the population of Brazil.Will you be changing your digital marketing strategy in China as a result of these findings?

The next question that online marketers may ask is how they can benefit from this, by improving their presence on the Search Engine Result Pages (SERP’s) of Baidu and Weibo.An interesting finding based on my preliminary research is that Baidu’s Weibo feeds frame doesn’t share the same ranking algorithm as Weibo does. Weibo’s ranking algorithm obviously allocates more weight to the social element. As you can see from the screenshot below, the Weibo post with the most comments and forward/retweets is ranking on the top, while the Weibo post from the account that I follow comes second, and then the post most recently released. However, this nicely calculated mathematics has not been adopted by Baidu, as the Baidu Weibo feeds frame shows different results. Like the listing title 最新微博结果 (the most recent weibo posts) indicates, the Baidu Weibo frame sequences the feeds in order of recency only.The simply applied algorithm doesn’t mean Baidu search scientists are not as good as Weibo’s, but proves that the API Weibo is sharing to Baidu doesn’t provide more information than the Weibo post itself. For example, the information on comments and retweets numbers are not shared, not to mention the social relation of Baidu searchers and Weibo accounts, because without logging into Baidu with a Weibo account (which doesn’t seem possible) Baidu cannot identify the social relation between the Weibo accounts with the searcher, and consequently it cannot show the preferred ranking for socially connected Weibo account feeds.Marketing IndicationThe above finding shows that even though Baidu tries to integrate social elements into the search results, the basic social attributes like social relation (followed VS not followed) and social engagement (the number of comments and retweets), don’t have any impact on the ranking. Posting as many popular keyword related Weibo posts via multiple Weibo accounts is the easiest way to get presence on the Baidu Weibo feeds frame. I will keep observing how Baidu will change the algorithm to overcome new spamming techniques coming from another platform.Tags: Baidu, Blogging, China, Microblogs, SEO, Sina Weibo, Social MediaCategory: SEO, SEO China, Social, Social Media China','article'),(3721,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/baidu-indexes-weibo-feeds-and-weibo-shuts-down-comments-china-search-social-integration/','Baidu Indexes Weibo Feeds and Weibo Shuts down Comments – China Search Social Integration','','An analysis of the indexing by Baidu of Sina Weibo comments and the recent shutdown of the commenting feature by Weibo in China by our Business Development Manager in China, Kun Tang.','About 4 weeks ago, as written about by my colleague Daniel, Baidu increased the indexation volume of Weibo feeds to accept Sina Weibo comments. Now for any popular terms, Baidu Search Engine Result Page (SERP) will show Weibo feeds in a scrolled-down frame in the same way Google uses to display Twitter feeds. This new feature is now much advanced when compared to 5 months ago, when Baidu was experimenting with the integration by only using the Weibo data from its own Open Platform, as now both Sina and Tencent Weibo share their API’s to the Baidu spider to collect Weibo content.However the issue is that Weibo’s only get indexed by Baidu when people query “popular terms”!For most Weibo feeds with search terms less popular than, for example, “林书豪伤停(Jeremy Lin injury)” (with average 900 queries per day) and “北京金隅夺冠 (Beijing Jinyu Won CBA Champion) (with average 1200 queries per day )”, they hardly stand a chance of appearing in the Baidu SERPs. It is therefore a common goal for both Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo to gain more presence with their Weibo feeds being indexed by Baidu.Interestingly on March 31 2012, both Sina and Tencent Weibo disabled their blog-like commenting features, one feature distinguishing themselves from Twitter , which was said to comply with the government authorities for 3 days. However, technical opinion is that disabling the commenting feature forces Weibo users to forward (retweet) the content, and since retweeting is easier than commenting to be indexed by Baidu, both Sina and Tencent Weibo temporarily forbid the commenting feature, so that more Weibo feeds could appear on the Baidu SERPs. In these circumstances, Sina and Tencent have an incentive to permanently forbid the commenting feature at the expense of their users experience.Now the three days disabling of weibo commenting is over, and Sina and Tencent Weibo have revived the commenting feature. It’s hard to say whether Weibo will ban that feature in the future, but one thing is very certain, i.e. Search and Social Integration is not going to stop.Tags: Baidu, Blogging, China, Microblogs, SEO, Sina Weibo, Social Media, Social SearchCategory: SEO, SEO China, Social, Social Media China','article'),(3723,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/social-media-china/page/2/','Social Media China | Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Baidu now shows Sina Weibo in search results Last month, Baidu announced on its weibo that Sina Weibo has started appearing in Baidu search results.

This feature has been launched in several other countries and it has finally arrived in Japan. It is an interesting development since as discussed in my recent post, Google is also partnering in Japan for search with Yahoo! Japan, which also has a popular online shopping function.Access to Google shopping is through http://www.google.co.jp/products or a tag will appear in the left section (Red box) as shown in the figure below when conducting a normal search.This new feature is still in Beta testing, however with registration and submission of content being free through the Google Merchant Center, the data base is increasing rapidly.Also shown in the figure on the left, when using Google shopping, a choice of filtering by price (In the red box), by brand (In the green box) and by other online retail sites that sell the products (In the blue box) is possible allowing consumers to compare prices in one place.Furthermore, a very interesting factor is that Amazon, Rakuten and Yahoo are not included in the list so far.The majority of the consumers that visit e-commerce sites often use Rakuten, Amazon and Yahoo. Having these major sites not indexed in the shopping could be quite irritating for users who tend to rely on those.Rakuten did submit its opposition to the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) in Japan requesting it to review the partnership between Yahoo and Google as also mentioned in my last post, however the FTC has now dismissed Rakuten’s concerns and approved the deal. Google’s decision to enter the “e-commerce” market could be costly to Rakuten. This is because in addition to making its new shopping function available through the web, it is also planning to make it available through Smartphone’s and iPhone’s which will bring in yet more traffic to its shopping site.Another theory of why the mega e-commerce sites are not included in Google Shopping could be the massive databases they possess, which could take time to fully integrate. Google shopping was launched recently and more time is needed to monitor the developments.So does this new feature mean anything for practioners of Japanese SEO? The answer will be yes. Search results in Google shopping links directly to the company that has registered, resulting in the consumer paying for the product directly through the owner sites, not Google. Moreover, Google announced that keywords will have a high relevancy in shopping results which will appear in the normal search results. Monitoring of your own registered products is possible as well with the Google Merchant Tool. If Google successfully increases its database and traffic to this new function, doing SEO for Google Shopping will be something to consider.Tags: Amazon, E-Commerce, Google, Google Japan, Google Shopping, Japan, Rakuten, Yahoo JapanCategory: E-commerce, E-commerce Japan','article'),(3737,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/google-shopping/','Google Shopping - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Thai Businesses Go Online with Google Thailand Online Shopping Feature Two months ago, I noticed a new feature on homepage of google.co.th with the introduction of the icon “Business solution” appearing near the bottom of the screen screen on the left hand side as shown in the below screenshot.

Teenage users were found more likely to be swayed by Twitter, whereas those in their twenties are more influenced by Facebook.The complete overview of the study reads as follows:Most respondents surveyed are trusting consumers who have already brought the product advertised (69.8%) or who listen to the opinion of friends and people they know (46%).

Here is an example for a community page in the SERP for the search term ‘System Engineer’:Upon clicking on a community page search result, users can gain access to a limited version of the page, displaying key information such as; group description, date of establishment or titles of the latest postings. Logging into Mixi is required to gain further access to the page selected.This new development will undoubtedly see the struggling Japanese SNS gain greater exposure on the internet. However, Mixi’s key SNS competitor in the region, Facebook, already makes community and group pages accessible through organic SERPS, rendering the implementation obsolete in comparison.To add, exactly how much value search engines will assign to Mixi community pages, and whether these results will then rank highly enough to generate organic traffic remains to be seen in the coming months following Mixi’s update.Tags: Japan SEO, Japan SNS, MixiCategory: Japan, SEO Japan, Social Media Japan','article'),(3745,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/latest-user-numbers-for-facebook-and-social-media-in-japan/','Latest User Numbers for Facebook and Social Media in Japan','','Atsushi Iwashita, Managing Director of Facebook Japan, shared his insights regarding the latest user numbers and future strategy of the second biggest soci','Atsushi Iwashita, Managing Director of Facebook Japan, shared his insights regarding the latest user numbers and future strategy of the second biggest social network in Japan.In an interview with The Nikkei, he stated that the number of monthly active users on Facebook was around 21 million as of the end of June 2013.Around 86% (18 million) of these users access Facebook via their mobile phones, topping the global average of 71%.This also exceeds the 8 million monthly mobile users Mixi has, Facebook’s biggest competitor in Japan. The number of mobile users accessing Facebook on a daily basis is 72%, which is also much higher than the global average of 57%.Companies that regularly cite Facebook user figures such as Cereja Technology Japan, usually refer to the numbers provided by Facebook’s own ad tool, which is not always the most reliable source.In May, the tool displayed user numbers of less than 14 million, signposting that support for Facebook could be fading in Japan due to the growing popularity of Naver Line.In the coming year, Iwashita plans to swiftly double the workforce of Facebook Japan and to start advertising campaigns including TV advertisements with the goal of increasing fans, users, revenue and influence in the Japanese SNS industry.It remains to be seen whether this will help to keep the international social networking site competitive with more local platforms.

However, comparing the visits of a website with user numbers of a smartphone application is not an apple-to-apple comparison.With reference solely to audience numbers of smartphone applications, Facebook is actually not lagging too far behind LINE as you can see in the following table for March 2013 by Nielsen NetRatings:1. LINE: 17.1 million2. Google Play: 16.1 million3. Google Maps: 14. 2 million4. Facebook: 14.1 million5. Google Search: 12.9 millionIn addition, Facebook’s recent drop in traffic could in part be explained by recent improvements to its mobile app. This update could be causing users to migrate from the PC to the mobile version.Mixi Executive Officer Yusuke Asakura said in a recent interview that the platform is also planning on participating in the smartphone market, as it aims to expand its current portfolio of two application to 50 apps.At this stage it is too early to signpost Facebook as losing out to LINE, as their focus and usage is totally different.However, two things seem to be very clear:1) There is substantial ongoing change in social media usage in Japan, which needs to be observed closely in the near future.2) The competition in the social media smartphone apps market is growing fierce, with more and more players trying to get their slice of the cake.Tags: Facebook Japan, Japanese SNS, LINE, MixiCategory: Japan, Social Media Japan','article'),(3751,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/japanese-sns/','Japanese SNS - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' New Developments in the Japanese Social Media Industry Part II After a sharp decline of Facebook’s Japanese user base, Mixi’s makeover and an increase in users of smartphone applications such as LINE, many are speculating as to what Japan’s Social Media future looks like.

The second raid on Naver since 2008The raid on NHN headquarters is not the first Naver has experienced, the search giant was investigated and later fined 277 million won in 2008.The company were found to be abusing their position as market leader by preventing a new video content provider from entering the market. However, NHN were able to dodge the fine as the FTC were unable to prove them guilty.The recent raid this month is aligned with the new “economic democratization” campaign of the Korean government.This campaign’s ultimate goal is to create a sound market that protects small businesses and customers, and is specifically aimed at big companies abusing their dominance in their respective markets.Implications for the Korean Search Engine Market The Anti-Monopoly Bureau are to determine whether Naver’s business practices hindered small and medium-sized content providers from entering the market, and whether consumers were negatively affected by that.It was also reported that a bill regulating large online players may be discussed in parliament soon.These latest developments and actions taken by the government might shake up the search engine market in Korea which is currently monopolized by Naver.The results of the investigation and future actions taken by the government in the wake of the “economic democratization” campaign within the Korean online market might bring substantial future change to the industry.Tags: Korea, Korea PPC, Korea SEM, NaverCategory: Korea, PPC Korea, SEO Korea','article'),(3773,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/ppc-korea/page/2/','PPC Korea | Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' SEM in Korea: Bing Now Showing PPC Advertisement from Daum The organic search engine market in Korea is currently dominated heavily by Naver.

Depending on the GPS location and time, the most relevant of 13 available categories will be shown in order of priority judged by historical search data, the time and location of the user.For example, weather and traffic related search terms are usually shown during peak commuting hours. Similarly, restaurant and café searches are shown during typical lunch and coffee break times, and TV- related search queries are suggested in the evening.With regards to location, Naver uses its own geographical cluster system. They system uses small units of measurement called Semantic Areas to provide localized search results based on the exact location of the user.Below are two scenarios of suggested search terms for Hot Searches Nearby. The left screenshot was taken in Gangnam district at 6.30 PM and mainly displays nearby restaurants and leisure/ entertainment related search terms.The right-hand screenshot was taken on Jeju Island on a Saturday at 3 PM and shows search terms related to tourist spots and restaurants in the surrounding area.Naver appears to take the enhancement of the user friendliness of its platform very seriously, and is constantly and consistently updating its algorithms and services.However, whether these updates are genuinely enhancing user experience of the mobile platform remains to be seen. Hopefully Naver will release data analysis of this at a later date to allow close inspection of the update’s effect on usability.Tags: Korea PPC, Korea SEM, Naver Algorithm update, Naver KoeraCategory: Korea, SEO Korea','article'),(3776,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/naver-koera/','Naver Koera - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Naver Implements New Search Algorithm for Mobile Naver is set to introduce a new function for mobile searches to challenge other Korean mobile search platforms.

The new technology presents users with','Naver has enhanced its instant search algorithm with a new function that anticipates users’ search intent.The new technology presents users with pre- set customized search results that provide answers to users’ queries.According to the search giant, this update is the next step towards their ultimate goal, and one shared by other search platforms, of being able to answer search queries in a natural and conversational way, like a human being.The new search algorithm is a hybrid blend of instant search, knowledge graph and additional special search features such as currency, weather and calculator features commonly found on other platforms.For this new feature, Naver focused on further developing its algorithm for NLU (Natural Language Understanding) and combining it with its newly established database called NCR (Naver Content Repository) Mashup.With the NLU, Naver is trying to understand natural language/sentences as opposed to refined keywords and then matching it up with the related data pulled from the NCR Mashup.The ‘normal’, single-dimensional search results are currently pulled from several independent and isolated databases. The new NCR Mashup tries to understand the connection between certain search terms and search results from those independent databases and creates a separate database for multi-dimensional search results.This new algorithm can be best understood by referencing examples. For instance, just by typing the word “highway” into the search field, Naver will still suggest to you the usual instant search results such as, “highway map”, “highway terminal prices”, or, “highway buses”.In addition to regular instant search suggestions, the new NCR Mashup tries to go one step further by anticipating more complex search intentions and suggests to answer questions such as, “tell me more about the current traffic situation on the highways” (see NCR Mashup box in screenshot below).Similar suggestions are given by just typing in other words such as “baseball” which trigger the following NCR Mashup suggestions: “show me the upcoming baseball games”, “show me the current baseball league standings”, and “I want to see the recent baseball highlights”.Another example of using the NCR Mashup search tool is upon searching for the word, “interesting”, the results read as follows: “recently popular movies”, “recently popular TV shows”, and “recently popular web cartoons”.Movie- related queries are another example of how this new database tries to understand complex search intensions. If a user watched a good movie and wants to know about other movies showing the same cast, it would require multiple search queries, such as “[actor A] movies”, “[actor B movies]”, etc.However, when typing in a search query such as “In which other movies does the cast of [movie A] appear?”, Naver will provide a custom designed overview of all actors in that movie and their filmography at one glance (see screenshot below).All of this information was available before the update, but required the user to look up each fact individually or to navigate through the results in order to acquire the desired answer.With the new NCR Mashup, Korean’s biggest search engine aims to cut down user effort by displaying the desired information right away.Naver will first implement this new algorithm for search queries in regard to celebrities, movies, and news broadcasting related information, before slowly rolling it out into other areas of the platform.The ultimate goal is to understand and reply to questions in a way someone would ask and answer in a verbal conversation, with natural sentences rather than keyword- refined search queries.The Korean search engine summarizes its long-term goals as follows: “From text to speech, from keywords to natural language and from one-dimensional to multi-dimensional search results – this is our dream.”Hopefully Naver will release some user data or insights to see how many are actually using this new features and whether it really does help the search giant brining it closer to its ultimate goal declared above.What’s your take on Naver’s new instant search algorithm?

Considering that Naver leads the Korean search engine market with a share of more than 70%, this announcement could cause a lot of turmoil in the Korean SEO industry.On November 26th, NHN Corp. released a press statement announcing the introduction of the new search algorithm ‘Libra’. The aim of the change is to push down over-optimised results in the search engine result pages and give way to more quality content on the upper positions. The implementation will be conducted gradually, starting with the most popular keywords and, for now, only within the blog section of the Naver search results.Considering the fact that 84% of all social media users in Korea are either reading or keeping a blog, this algorithm change is going to have a big impact on the blogging scene and the search engine optimization industry as well, as blogs are an integral part of the natural search results on Naver.The main goal of the algorithm is to distinguish trustworthy, original content from over-optimised, less credible postings. Trustworthy content is determined by factors such as the number of clicks or the age and activity rate of the blog. For now, Naver only reveals these little hints in order to prevent new black hat activities, which is the reason for introducing this new algorithm in the first place.Changes are going to affect the rankings of more than 300 million existing blog posts and several tens of thousands new blog post every day. The implementation will happen gradually, starting with popular search terms, such as “good restaurants in …“, and is going to be expanded over time.I know at first hand that these changes are being considered as very severe within the Korean SEO community. Naver will give out guidelines together with the release of the algorithm at the beginning of December on how to adapt to the new rules and changes.

As a consequence Korean SEO is also constantly evolving. One of the most noticeable trends in the internet market in Korea is the increasing use of social networking services and the number of their users. In order to adapt quickly to these new trends, Naver and Daum, the most influential search engines in Korea, have both launched new services which show search results based on users social networking connections. For both of these services, searches are based on the account holder’s social connections within Naver and Daum. These new services are useful in that the results are personalized and customized since they only sort information from users’ own online connections. Naturally, as users continue to make more connections, more results will be displayed in the tailored search results of these new services. Now, let me introduce you to these new services in detail.Naver- ‘Social Network’Naver’s new search platform is called ‘Social Network’ and it was launched in October 2010. ‘Social Network’ results can only be found if you are logged into your Naver account as it uses your social network connections on your personal account to search for results. Network connections include your blog ‘neighbors’, members of cafés that you’re registered to and Me2Day friends. ‘Social Network’ search is more convenient and provides a differentiated service compared to the regular combined search. For example, the results shown in the ‘Social Network’ category may seem more useful and reliable to the user since the provider of the information is someone you know or share interests with. In order to view the results on the ‘Social Network’ more easily, you can change the settings so that you can combine or separate the results from blogs, cafés, and/or microblogs.Daum- ‘My Social’Daum’s new search platform is called ‘My Social’ and it was launched in December 2010. Similar to that of Naver, it basically is another search category that only shows results based on your social networking connections. These connections may be cafes you’re registered to, your blog and other blogs you’re neighbors with, your ‘view’ and other ‘view’ you’ve subscribed to and posts you’ve written on ‘Agora’. The results can be viewed on the combined search results page or also under the ‘My Social’ tab. Of course, you must be logged into your account if you wish to see any results listed under ‘My Social’.Naver’s ‘Social Network’ VS. Daum’s ‘My Social’/Comparison between the two servicesOne of the good things about any result within ‘Social Network’ or ‘My Social’ is that the information may be very trustworthy since the source of the information is from someone you know, either on-line or off-line. So, with the launch of these services, users can find useful information more easily and quickly. To make better use of these new features on Naver and Daum, users will no doubt keep building connections so that they can get a more comprehensive set of results. From an SEO Korea perspective, companies wishing to broaden their exposure in the Korean search market should be looking to increase the volume of their content on social networking services like cafés, blogs and Me2Day to cover as many search categories as possible for the products or services they wish to promote. Then when users of these new social search platforms on Naver and Daum conduct searches, there will be more opportunities for such products or services to be found.

These programs enable you to post something on any platform out of the three options (Twitter, Me2Day, Naver blog), and then your post will automatically be delivered to one or more of the other platforms. Such programs are a useful tool for social media marketing and more broadly disseminating your company’s message.The first program to discuss, since Me2Day and the Naver blog are run by the same company, NHN Corp., is the program on Naver that links posts on Me2Day and the Naver blog to each other. You can easily set your settings on both platforms and your post on the Naver blog will appear at the same time you upload it on Me2Day and vice versa. If you use this program, a lot of time and energy can be saved since you need not post the same thing twice.Second is a program called Me2Day to Twitter that can be found at http://me2twit.kkung.net/. In order to use this program, you must have an account for both Twitter and Me2Day. One thing to be aware of is that this program only sends Me2Day posts to Twitter and not the other way around and attached links and linked images sometimes get omitted in the delivery process. So at this stage it is not entirely reliable, but still useful.In any event, these programs can be very useful especially if you are trying to promote your business or do social media marketing in Korea.In summary, the Korean social media landscape is dynamic and social media marketing using the abovementioned most popular micro-blogs and programs in Korea can certainly prove to be a worthwhile exercise in engaging your target audience and disseminating the message of your brand.Tags: Korea, Me2Day, Naver Blog, Social Media, TwitterCategory: Social, Social Media Korea','article'),(3798,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/me2day/','Me2Day - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Useful programs for Social Media Marketing in Korea In my last post I spoke from a Korean SEO perspective about the booming use of Social Networking Services in Korea with the two main platforms currently in use being Me2Day (which is owned by Naver – Korea’s biggest search engine) and Twitter.

These two platforms are similar yet very different in terms of their user bases and membership participation levels with such differences being relevant for marketers in Korea. Let me start by introducing, from a Korean perspective, the two different social networking service platforms or micro-blogging platforms most commonly used in Korea; Twitter and Me2Day.Twitter Twitter started to become popular in Korea after the South Korean election in 2008 when it was used by candidates to get their message out and by voters to make their own commentary on the elections. The most active Twitter users in Korea now include many celebrities, ‘chae-bol’ (Korean conglomerates) executives, writers, athletes and social figures. Like in the west their presence on Twitter has resulted in them becoming very influential, with many of their followers and fans joining Twitter, too. Me2DayMe2Day is a Korean social networking/micro-blogging platform started in 2007 and is run by NHN Corp. which also runs Naver, Korea’s biggest search engine. Unlike Twitter, which limits posts to no more than 140 characters, the posts on Me2Day can be as long as users want. Me2Day adopts a more managed approach to promoting itself unlike twitter which is more organic. Me2Day holds Q&A sessions with famous athletes and entertainers and recently held a Q&A event with Korean football legend Cha Bum-Keun, a.k.a. Cha Bum, during the World Cup period and a previous MLB player Bong Jung-Keun while he participated in the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games.Comparison of Twitter and Me2dayOne important initial distinction between the two different platforms for Korean SEO and Social Media specialists to note is that Me2Day is only available for use within Korea whereas Twitter has a global user base. In terms of popularity and awareness, while Twitter of course is very well known because of its global platform and high profile “Tweeters”, Me2Day actually has a substantially higher number of users across all age groups. For marketers trying to create awareness about their products or services with Korean citizens Me2Day should be the initial go-to platform. This is demonstrated by the below two tables comparing user volumes and age-groups across the two platforms.Key Points to note:Tags: Korea, Me2Day, Social Media, TwitterCategory: Social, Social Media Korea','article'),(3802,'http://www.searchblog.asia/global/seo-global/more-google-functionality-coming-to-south-east-asia/','More Google Functionality Coming to South East Asia','','Residents in South East Asia can look forward to a new bunch of services from Google in a move to meet the needs of a growing market.

Google expects another one billion people globally to join the online masses by 2015, with most of them coming from their emerging markets.As reported by The Nation, Google is currently making investments in order to establish data centres across the SEA region. This will enable the search engine’s products to work better in Asia. They are reportedly spending US$700 million setting up centres in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan.Although China is not seen as an emerging market as such, they still believe that there are plenty of incentives for Google to continue its work in Asia. This is demonstrated by their commitment to rolling out Voice Search in Thai, along with other services for businesses.And to prove that they really mean business over here, Google has been running with the “Go Online” scheme in Thailand for businesses and the “Free Zone” in the Philippines to help people gain access to Gmail and other apps without a mobile data plan.Overall, it means that the next few years of Internet uptake will be pretty important to Google’s regional office. If the penetration rate goes on as they anticipate, there will be a lot of new Internet users just waiting to use their products and services.Tags: Google Thailand, InternetCategory: SEO, SEO Global, SEO Thailand','article'),(3804,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/internet/','Internet - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' More Google Functionality Coming to South East Asia Residents in South East Asia can look forward to a new bunch of services from Google in a move to meet the needs of a growing market.

Statistics from NECTEC show that the percentage of Thai users shopping online has risen from 47.8% in 2010 to 57.2% in 2011 which is already a 9.4% increase from the previous year.These statistics confirm that Thai users are becoming more familiar with online-shopping and many companies are starting to use online business strategies to attract more customers.The factors driving the increase in Thailand e-commerce1. Online payment system developmentIn the past, Thailand e-commerce companies just had credit cards to support online payments however credit cards in Thailand have not in the past been that popular.Now more payment systems are developing and users have many choices to make an online payment such as using credit cards, debit cards or online payment service companies.All of the Thai banks give priority to online payments, and have developed systems that can accept debit cards or allow internet banking to make an online payment. The money will directly be deducted from user accounts after products have been purchased.Online Payment Service Companies are another choice for users that don’t have credit cards. There are currently 3 companies in Thailand providing these services including Paysbuy, PayPal and TARADpay.Moreover, Thailand also has MPay and True Money services to support users that would like to make a payment via mobile. Users are obviously finding it more convenient to shop and make payments online.2. Ease of creation of e-commerce websitesA lot of companies in Thailand provide instant e-commerce websites where you can create a new online shop with in 24 hours. It’s easy to create by just following the instructions. This in turn has enabled the number of online shops to increase substantially each year.Additionally, last year big shopping malls in Thailand including Central, The Mall, Big C, and Lotus began to start online shopping campaigns to increase sales volumes which has provided users with more choices to select products they want.3. E-commerce shops always have promotionsE-commerce shops have a lot of competitors so most online shops try to attract customers by offering lower product prices or conducting special promotions. This is another reason that the number online shoppers in Thailand is increasing.4. Group buying Trends In Thailand Group buying trends on social e-commerce is also increasing. The price of products will decrease when buyers join together to buy the product with the greater the number of buyers, the lower the price. Therefore most buyers will spread the news about such promotions via social networks like Facebook. Such a strategy can attract more users to buy products on the internet.The Top 5 Thailand E-commerce websites as ranked by truehits.net ref:http://shopping.truehits.net/ are:1.

And the percentage of orders for cosmetics, electrical appliances and toys is also increasing.I believe that the trend of using e-commerce in Thailand will continue to grow in 2011 and beyond. Therefore if your business has not yet joined an e-commerce site or set one up of its own, now is the right time to do so.Tags: E-Commerce, Market Research, PantipMarket, Pramool, Tarad, Thailand, ThaiOnlineMarket, WeLoveShoppingCategory: E-commerce, E-commerce Thailand','article'),(3809,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/pantipmarket/','PantipMarket - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Thailand E-Commerce Trends in 2011 This year (2011) Thailand e-commerce is growing very fast with the behavior of Thai users changing rapidly.

These factors have also had a significant effect on the number of users of Social networking services in Thailand as can be seen from the following chart.Reference: http://trends.google.com/websites?q=facebook.com%2C+hi5.com%2C+twitter.com%2C+youtube.com%2Clinkedin.com&geo=TH&date=all&sort=0The above statistics demonstrate that Thai users of Social networks is increasing dramatically. In the Year 2011, the most popular Social network in Thailand is Facebook, with the second being Youtube and the third being Hi5. From the graph above, we can analyse the trends of each social media network in Thailand:Hi5Actually Hi5 is the first social network that Thai users used and has been very popular since 2009. The graph shows that the number of Thai users of Hi5 in 2009 was more than Facebook and Hi5 could attract users by by enabling them to create their own profiles, upload photos, and share them with friends. At that time this feature was quite new and very attractive to Thai users. Therefore in the year 2009 Hi5 was the most popular social network in Thailand, that is, until Facebook started gaining more popularity.FacebookFacebook started becoming popular in Thailand in 2010. The main factor in its increased popularity in Thailand was due to its Game applications which enable users to play games online with their friends. This feature is not available on Hi5 and so Facebook, as can be seen from the above graph, has now overtaken Hi5 in terms of user numbers. Examples of the games Facebook users in Thailand find appealing are Farmville, Café World , and Restaurant City.YoutubeThe improvements in, and spread of, broadband speed and connectivity in Thailand has been the most important factor in making Youtube more popular in Thailand, as it is now more faster and easier for for people to upload and watch videos than was previously the case.Twitter The concept of Twitter is quite new to Thais and at this stage the number of Twitter users is still significantly less than for Hi5, Facebook and Youtube. However, in 2011, the number of Twitter users has begun to increase with most new users being Celebrities, Actors/Actresses, Reporters, and Politicians. The below graph shows the statistics for the Top 20 Thai Twitter users based on followers:-Reference: http://www.marketingoops.com/digital/social-media/twitter-social-media/top-20-thais/1. @Thaksinlive (Politician) – 26,512 followers2. @PM_Abhisit (Politician) – 21,300 followers3. @Suthichai (Reporter) – 11,342 followers4. @WoodyTalk (Actor/ Celebrity) – 11,150 followers5. @Kalamare (Actress/ Celebrity) - 8,340 followers6. @KornDemocrat (Politician) – 7,858 followers7. @Nuishow (IT specialist) – 6,782 followers8. @punlapa (Actress/ Celebrity) – 6,494 followers9. @apirak_bangkok (Politician) has 4,962 followers10 @Ceemeagain (IT Specialist) has 4,289 follwers11. @Sugree (IT Specialist) has 4,133 followers12. @Mktmag (Marketing specialist) has 3,875 followers13. @Panraphee (Celebrity) has 3,536 followers14. @Jjetrin (Actor/Celebrity) has 3,380 followers15 @ Dungtrin (Dhamma) has 3,363 followers16. @Macroart (IT specialist) has 3,349 followers17. @GTHChannel (Entertainment) has 3,345 followers18. @iwhale (IT specialist) has 3,249 followers19. @GybzyGB (Celebrity) has 3,050 followers20. @Bayfridoy (Celebrity) has 2,511 followersConclusion:From my point of view, the number of Thai users for social media will continue to grow rapidly as incomes continue to increase and more and more people get broadband services.

The features follow the concept of the Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) system. Thai Domain Names can work with the internet system in the same way as English Domain names, with no need to change the DNS. As an example of the usefulness for search engine ranking purposes of using a Thai Domain Name, I would like to provide the following case study.Case Study:The Thai Domain Management Company (TDM) in Thailand registered the following domain name in Thai language http://เกมส์.com (this website is about Games).Only 2 months after launching this website, http://เกมส์.com achieved a ranking of number 3 on the first page of Google Thailand. In December 2009, they received 143,000 page views/day and have in total received 3.35 million page views.The Marketing Director of TDM, Mr.Krucheewan, said that the company never expended any costs on marketing for this website and most traffic comes from search engines, especially Google.TDM achieved such good results in a short time frame by using a popular keyword to register the Domain name. The keyword Game (เกมส์) is a popular keyword and has high search volume in Thailand and so therefore it’s not difficult to get a higher ranking in a short period of time. Of course, it is believed the use of a domain name in Thai also helped the rankings on Google which sees it as relevant for the Thai market.As a result of receiving such high traffic and page views, http://เกมส์.com can earn more income from sponsors that have an interest in advertising on their website i.e. through banners.In summary, the benefitsof using a Thai Domain Name are:1. More convenience for local users to search in Thai language and potentially higher click through rates2. Potentially higher rankings on Google, the dominant Thai search engine, than would otherwise be the case than if just using an English domain nameTags: Google, Google Thailand, keyword rankings, SEO, Thai Domain Name System, Thailand, ThaiURLCategory: SEO, SEO Thailand','article'),(3822,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/keyword-rankings/','keyword rankings - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Basic tips for improving keyword rankings As a Seoer, our duty is how to improve the keywords ranking of our client’s websites every day.

If “Content is King”, then surely “Backlinks are Queen”. In terms of backlinking strategies, we also know that quality links coming from within a local market or country are potentially more valuable for SEO than having the same quality links coming in from another country.A common method used by many SEO’s to get backlinks is through directory and article submissions. In Thailand however, it is quite difficult to find good quality local directory and article submission sites. Even if you can find directory submission sites, my experience as an SEO Thailand practioner is there is a long waiting time before your website gets posted on them. Furthermore, many of the more well known article submission sites are not based in Thailand and often don’t accept articles in Thai language, particularly if your website has been localized and the default language is in Thai. In fact, it can be quite difficult to do quality link building in Thailand.The Alternative of Social BookmarkingIf you have also experienced such difficulties as mentioned above or are wishing to commence a Thailand SEO strategy, then one attractive alternative which has worked well for me and has produced results quickly is to use Thai social bookmarking services to get backlinks. Such a strategy can still be done in parallel with your article and directory submission efforts, if you still wish to pursue those.Social bookmarking is a fast method which helps you increase traffic and backlinks at the same time. You also can get page rank (PR) from social bookmarking websites if you choose those with Dofollow settings. Moreover, social bookmarking can help achieve greater indexation from robots in a shorter period.The ResultsThe graph below shows the ranking improvement results I was able to achieve recently for one of my clients’ Thai websites through the use of social bookmarking.To achieve these results, I submitted their chosen Thai keywords to various Thai social bookmarking sites everyday for 4 weeks, with the rankings for every keyword rising substantially during the same period, as is shown in the graph.The results are impressive and clearly demonstrate that social bookmarking services can have a positive impact on rankings. If you are looking to do SEO in Thailand then I strongly recommend you consider employing such a strategy.Tags: Content Writing, Google Thailand, Link Building, Onsite Optimization, SEO, Social Bookmarking, ThailandCategory: SEO, SEO Thailand','article'),(3827,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/social-bookmarking/','Social Bookmarking - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' How to get quality local backlinks in Thailand To achieve higher rankings we all know that you need the best quality content and good quality in-coming links.

The statistics below show that the number of Internet users in Thailand has been rapidly increasing every year from about 1998 onwards. The internet usage penetration in Thailand has also increased dramatically each year as can be seen from the graph below which indicates an increase in user rates from only 3.7% of the population in the year 2000 to an impressive 26.3% as at 2010.These statistics clearly demonstrate a rapidly growing internet market in Thailand which represents a good opportunity for companies to start thinking about and implementing Thailand SEO strategies.*Population in Thailand from Ministry of Interior (Thailand) Changing technology and rising income levels are playing a big part in the rapid growth of the internet in Thailand. As can be seen from the graph below, Thailand’s average monthly income has been on a steady rise over the past 10 years which also corresponds to the increasing internet usage rates demonstrated above:-In Thailand with affordable new technologies users can connect to the internet in multiple ways: including from broadband or mobile internet. There are various other factors in addition to those just mentioned that are attracting more users of the internet in Thailand: 1. With the advent of smart phone technology that can support mobile internet connectivity; it’s easier to connect to the internet from many areas in Thailand, more cheaply than using PC’s.2. Smart Mobile devices offer lots of widgets/gadgets and applications that further promote pervasive use of the internet3. Application of social networks such as games, news, research & online shopping that attract a wider demograph of users.In addition to the above Thai users are increasingly using search engines for research and other search related activities as can be seen from the below statistics showing the increasing usage of search engines in Thailand from 2007-2009The strategy to optimize your website in Thailand is not as difficult to do when compared with other countries in Asia because Thailand has no local search engines like Baidu in China or Naver in Korea. Google is only major search engine in Thailand with over 90% market share as the below statistics show. Therefore Thailand SEO strategies need to be implemented for Google only. Moreover, overall optimization efforts in Thailand are currently lower when compared with western markets which is another reason that implementing successful SEO strategies in Thailand is not as difficult as other more developed markets.The internet in Thailand is becoming more reliable and convenient to connect to using both broadband and mobile internet products. The Thai economy continues to grow and disposable incomes for Thai people are on the rise. Users are turning to search engines and social media sites to keep updated with trends and news and also for shopping. These factors combined with the overall low level of competition in SEO in Thailand means any early investment in SEO by a company can pay off significantly.

It is perceived as being a channel that you can precisely control, where you’re able to see exactly where your spend is going and which part of your budget is working.Whilst Google AdWords has proven to be a relatively robust model, with decent tools available to manage your campaigns, there’s a good chance that it may not be your main market in Asia. As we know, Google isn’t necessarily the largest player here, so you’re likely to get better results elsewhere. For anyone who’s paying attention to Hong Kong’s local market for example, you will want to have a good presence on Yahoo!.While Yahoo!’s Sponsored Search online interface is fairly straight forward, there isn’t an equivalent of AdWords Editor to help you make mass changes. Modifying large parts of your campaign will still be done offline, and then you’re able to push these live via their bulksheet import feature.On the downside, it is not as obviously easy to do as you might have hoped it would be. Sadly it isn’t just a case of pasting into the right section as it is with AdWords Editor, for example. You need to upload your CSV file, but it has to be in Yahoo!’s preferred format, rather than any CSV file. You should be able to download their template file before you import, but if you can’t find it, here it is.There are a number of rules that you need to take into account in order to use this file successfully. Depending on what part of the account you want to change, you will need to enter information into certain columns, but not necessarily others. It gets particularly complicated if you are making changes to an existing ad group, rather than just creating a new ad group.Make sure that you plan through the steps as much as you can in order to reduce the upload errors. If you are modifying an existing ad group, bear in mind that you will need to have the Ad Group ID and Campaign ID entered. If you are making changes at the keyword level, you’ll need the Keyword ID if it already exists. The trickiest part is probably working out what the actual ID values are. You should be able to export your current account in order to find that information.Additionally, each row that you enter into the file will also need to be defined as a ‘Component Type’. So if it’s a negative keyword, you will need to specify so, along with campaigns and ad groups. Lining up all of these variables can be a challenge, but once it’s all set, the process of getting everything live appears to be quite logical.It is also worth noting the limits for the Ad Title and Ad Short Description columns. Whereas you may be used to the generous limits in Google, Yahoo! caps titles at 15 characters, and then there is only one line of description which is limited to 38 characters. Of course, this proves to be quite limiting for English, but for Chinese language, it should be enough.To prepare for your bulk uploads further, we managed to find Yahoo!’s detailed explanation of the process.Tags: PPC, Yahoo, Yahoo PPCCategory: PPC, PPC Global','article'),(3835,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/yahoo-ppc/','Yahoo PPC - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' An Introduction to Yahoo!

There is solid logic behind this thinking,','The general consensus in the SEO industry is that link building should only ever be done from ‘do follow’ sites. There is solid logic behind this thinking, and it makes sense that you would want to spend time building links from sites that allow spiders to follow. Google even has its own answer on the subject.Having said that, should you become very picky with your link building partner sites? Many SEO professionals will encourage you to focus on gaining as many ‘do follow’ links as possible, whilst avoiding the ‘no follow’ kind. It makes sense that if you’re going to chase a link, that you chase one that is going to benefit you the most.From my personal experience, however, I would like to share something that somewhat goes against this thinking.In one of my previous jobs, I was responsible for the SEO performance for the site. Being a publisher, it was easy to have a lot of fresh, good, unique content. The editorial team would take care of this in their own jobs.With all the content we had, the best way for us to build links was to share it all with partners. At the same time, we were able to build links back to our selected landing pages. We didn’t have many partners, as there is always a fear of just duplicating our content in multiple portals. So we went with quality over quantity, and had our content displayed on one of the largest portals in the Asia region.The portal in question has an SEOMoz root domain authority of 100 and is a top 10 site on Alexa. It also has a Google PageRank of 7, but all of the external links were ‘no follow’ types. With the amount of traffic the partnership could bring us, it made sense to continue partnering with them, even if the links were not the right type.Over the course of a year, we shared roughly 5 articles a week with our big portal partner. There were plenty of links back to our site, meaning we had built up a gigantic source of high quality, highly controlled links. The results were very positive.Not only were we benefiting from traffic referrals, but our SEO traffic had steadily increased during that time. Comparing year on year figures, we had almost doubled our weekly organic search traffic to roughly 25,000 visits.While it’s true that we had partnered with other websites, these were not on a regular basis and with fewer pieces each week. They were certainly nowhere near as influential as our main partner, even though they allowed ‘do follow’ links. For me, this little example demonstrates that ‘no follow’ links do carry some weight, and obviously it helps if the source is a highly credible website.So, my advice for anyone who is carrying out link building is that you shouldn’t be too picky. Whilst it’s important to get ‘do follow’ links to your site, it wouldn’t be such a bad thing if you have some ‘no follow’ links too.Here is some extra reading on the topic from SEOMoz and Search Engine Journal.

This means we need to design the landing page carefully when we are publishing the ads. To improve Quality Score, we need to improve the loading time of the landing page – the faster, the better.How does the loading time of the landing page affect the Quality Score?Google uses landing page load time as a factor in its Quality Score to ensure that users get the best experience possible after clicking an ad. In addition, if a landing page is used in multiple ad groups, the same landing page score gets carried across to all keywords within all groups.What affects landing page loading time?1. Redirects: Some advertisers want to use redirects to track the traffic better, but it takes up precious time when you open a webpage, it would be better to avoid using too much.2. Code and page file size: If there are a lot of pictures, CSS, JS and text in the landing pages, it can take an age to load. If it’s possible to compress images, or remove redundant code, do it.3. Server: It will be a big problem if the server is very slow. You need find a good and stable provider for your website before you do the Google Adwords.To help you reduce your page loading time, refer to the Yahoo!’s best practices guide.Google AdWords will continuously measure the landing page load times.

I am writing this because it scares me to see how many E-commerce sites are out there which are not search engine and user friendly and which will struggle succeeding organically in many search engines as a result.The following are some minimal points which should be taken into account from an SEO perspective for anyone who is thinking of or in process of creating an E-commerce site.1 . URL RewritesThere are so many sites out there that still that do not have their URL structure correctly set up. This could be due to a heavy focus on design or content at the outset, at the expense of the very important technical aspects of websites designed with SEO in mind.In the same way that it is important to have target keywords included in the content and meta data etc, it is also important to have a URL structure that is easy to understand and describes what the page is talking about, and which preferably contains target keywords in the URL’s as well.For example:www.example.com/product/bags/work-bagswww.example.com/store/products/View?ID=5487634productID=8722348&locad=8Obviously the upper URL already suggests that the page is about bags with a main focus on work-bags, while the lower URL does not represent or tell anything about the page on a URL level.Some might think this to be a very small thing; however making your URL’s as clear as possible does provide a better impression to everyone (including search engines), and better demonstrates what a particular page on a site is actually talking about. If you can put relevant keywords in the URL’s then that is even better. You may refer to the following site for a more detailed explanation of URL rewrites.2. Choose the right keyword for the right page With hundreds and thousands of pages, E-commerce sites can be overflowing with information on prices, product descriptions, reviews, legal information, delivery methods, and so on, so make sure you are aware of the keywords you are targeting and wanting to have rank high organically. Such keywords should be placed on your most relevant target landing pages throughout the site.Deciding on the right keywords will allow you to write more specific content and enable more specific theming of target landing pages which can be expanded in future by using additional related target keywords to capture more search engine traffic.3. One topic per pageWhen creating pages on your E-commerce site, be sure to use one topic or theme per page for your products.For example, you don’t want to have a page that both talks about bags and shoes. Why? Search engines don’t like pages that cover multiple topics as they can’t identify what exactly the pages are focusing on. Additionally, if users are searching for bags and arrive on a page that lists multiple other products in addition to bags, the chances are they will not have a very good user experience and may even leave the page or site if they do not immediately and easily find what they are looking for.4. Bread Crumbs, Internal LinkingBecause E-commerce sites can have hundreds and thousands of pages, it is important to make the site as SEO friendly as possible by also making good use of bread crumbs. Make sure your bread crumbs are simple for users, as well as for search engine spiders. Making simple bread crumbs is the key, as in my first example below. The second example is of a poor use of bread crumbs, which included a complete duplication of the page title for the specific page I was viewing.Example of good bread crumb:Home > Store > Product > BagsExample of poor bread crumb:Home > The best store with all products you need > Find the best item from our 1,000 + items > Bags | The best qualityInternal linking should be designed to ensure link juice is spread throughout your website, so that all important pages on your site rank well for their targeted keywords. You can read more about internal linking here. Make sure you include target keywords in your anchor text when setting up the internal linking for your site. For example, it is important that if you have a product page for sports bags, that any internal links on that page should contain target page keywords and should also link to other hand bag pages, in order to maximize the page authority and relevancy for each page, as well as to provide a better user experience.Remember, if your site looks messy to humans, it will probably look the same from a search engines point of view.5. Unique Content / Enrich with contentIt is true that a picture tells a thousand words, but a picture alone isn’t sufficient for E-commerce sites. Users want full descriptions; they want to know more about the products that they are interested in. Make sure you have relevant keyword focused content included in your product pages. I have seen countless sites that simply upload a nice image (which is also important), but offer only minimal product details, such as colors, sizes, and availability. This information is definitely necessary, but make sure you also include a section that describes the product in more detail, so you can use your targeted keywords in this content.Be sure not use the descriptions provided straight from the manufacturers product feed. Search engines, like people value original content. By using this content verbatim, you’re offering little value to both humans and search engines. Instead write unique, personalized content whenever possible to avoid duplicate content issues and a weak reception from visitors.These pages are the most valuable pages on your E-commerce site as, after all, they’re the ones where conversions take place.Tags: Content Writing, E-Commerce, Link Building, SEO, Site ArchitectureCategory: E-commerce, E-commerce Global, SEO, SEO Global','article'),(3844,'http://www.searchblog.asia/global/page/2/','Global | Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Basic tips for improving keyword rankings As a Seoer, our duty is how to improve the keywords ranking of our client’s websites every day.

If the sites are distributed over CDN and are set up to be multiple hostnames that serve the same exact content (that is, to create a duplicate content issue), it’s strongly recommended to implement rel=”canonical” or another canonicalization technique to avoid the duplicate content problem.One of the signals the search engines use to geotarget websites is the IP address. If the sites are distributed over a very large, global CDN, the sites might associate with many IPs over different regions and search engines may associate the website with an incorrect geographic region based on the IP address. For Google, the solution to such a situation is to set the correct geotargeting by using Google Webmaster Tools.In accordance with Baidu’s Search Engine Guidelines, when discussing if the CDN will affect indexation, Baidu says that the way Baiduspider crawls sites is just like a user visiting the websites. Once visitors can access the site content, Baiduspider can crawl that content as well.When properly designed and implemented, a CDN can improve access to the data it caches by increasing access bandwidth and redundancy and reducing access latency. For search engines such as Google, one of the signals the algorithms use to determine crawl rate is the server response as perceived by search engine bots. To distribute the site content over CDN properly not only improves the user experience but also makes the website more search engine friendly. All in all, we can say that the impact from using CDN on SEO is positive, so if you are now considering using CDN to distribute your content, just go ahead.Tags: Baidu, Baidu Spider, content delivery networks, Geotargeting, Google, International, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Global','article'),(3848,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/felix-cen/','Felix Cen - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Will using Content Delivery Networks affect SEO As technology advances, more and more companies distribute their website content over Content Delivery Networks (“CDN”), instead of hosting sites on a single server.

In this article, I will keep discussing how to code in a search engine friendly way in HTML5.1. Use new HTML5 elements instead of generic <div id=””> in defining overall structure:1) <header> is a group of introductory/navigation which is different from <head>. <header> may be used directly under the body, or inside an individual article/section.2) <footer>may contain author information, related documents, copyright data, etc. Footer may be used directly under the body, or inside an individual article/section.3) <nav>can contain a group of links that point to other pages.4) <section>represent one paragraph/block of content.5) <aside>is a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content. It can be used for typographical effects like pull quotes or sidebars, for advertising, for groups of nav elements, and for other content that is considered separate from the main content of the page.2. Use the tag appropriately.1) Nesting the tags appropriately.Elements like div、ul、ol、dl、p cannot be nested in elements like a、span、strong、em、p、h1~h6.2) Caution on using too many div, span and table. Below are some standard uses of different html tags.<p> is used for text content/paragraphs.<dl> is used for defined list, e.g. list of headings, list of summaries.<ul> is for undefined list.<ol> is for ordered list.<h1>~<h6> is for content headings. There is only one H1 allowed on each page.<strong>/<em> is for important and emphasized text.<img> is for images. ALT tag is mandatory. Background and buttons should be handled by css not <img>.Any clock element that does not fit into the HTML5 tags can go into a div, but it has to have id property and label to clarify its purpose of use.3. Use appropriate form structure.1) Use fieldset to group the same fields.2) Use legend to name the different categories.3) Use CSS width to define the width of the textbox not the size property.4) Use maxlength to control the length of input.4. Set standards when naming the tags.1) Use 3 letter abbreviations as the suffix of id name for different tags. For example:Label: lblText: txtPassword: txtTextarea: txtFile: txtRadio: radCheckbox: chkSubmit: btnReset: btnButton: btnHidden: hid2) Name the class meaningfully.Use “-“to connect the words in the name.3) NameKeep it consistent to the id and use camel case, for example, id=”txt-id-card”, name=”idCard”.These are just some basic standards that we should follow in our practice in order to make search engines understand your web pages easier.Tags: HTML5, International, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Global','article'),(3855,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/html5/','HTML5 - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Exploring search engine friendly practice in HTML5 – Part 2 As I mentioned in my earlier post, HTML is the latest specification for HTML and in HTML5 there are a lot of new attributes and tags which can be used for SEO.

China has been fighting losing battles on various fronts over the past few years. It has seen its search engine market share fall further behind Baidu as smaller competitors open up. Not only that, but its strength as a news portal has been lessened as users choose to visit competitors such as Sina instead.According to the analyst You Tianyu, music service providers struggle to “balance income with expenditure”, even for QQ Music, one of the more popular services. You goes on to explain Yahoo! China’s plight by saying, “the online music service brings high costs with relatively low returns under current business conditions in China.”With so much evidence laid out bare, it’s something of a no-brainer decision.

Japan, published the most popular keyword terms for 2012.Yahoo! Japan presents the keywords in five main categories and in additional five special categories. The main categories are:The additional five special categories include topics such as ‘Most Popular Keywords Among Kids’, ‘Most Popular Keywords Among Tablet Users’, or ‘Most Searched Athlete From the Olympic games 2012’.The overall most popular keywords on Yahoo! Japan for 2012 are ‘YouTube’, ‘Facebook’ and ‘Amazon’, followed by ‘Tenraku’, ‘Google’ and ‘Mixi’. Below you can find the top ten of the overall most popular keywords as found on the Yahoo! Japan website. The column on the right side presents the changes compared to last year. Especially Facebook seems to have gained a lot of popularity compared to last year.For more detailed rankings and all the other categories, just take a look at the report, there are some pretty interesting findings (e.g. Facebook even made it to number 1 in the smartphone search category).Most searched terms on Google JapanGoogle Japan’s 2012 keyword rankings are categorised into three main areas:The category ‘General Keywords’ is again divided into ‘All Keywords’, ‘Mobile Search Keywords’ and ‘Company Name Keywords’.Here is an overview of the general keywords rankings 2012:Hot topic keyword rankings for 2012 are divided into no less than 16 categories. Some example categories are News, People (male, female), Politics (worldwide, local), Recipes, How to…, or TV Dramas. Here is the overall top-ten list for all Hot Topic keywords.Regional (or in Japan’s case prefectural) rankings for 2012 can be found here. By scanning over the findings, you can see that many Japanese people searched for fireworks and a very new trend of mass-meetups on the street called ‘街コン’ in their neighbourhood or prefecture in the last year.Summarising the statistics of both search engines, I would say that Facebook is the biggest winner this year followed by the usual web giants (YouTube, Amazon, Tenraku) and a focus on travelling when it comes to company searches (4 out of the top 6 companies are from the travelling industry).What do you think about the Japan rankings for 2012?

Every time Google switched the location of the file, The Great Firewall was quick to react in blocking it until the script was finally embedded into the HTML, meaning that the only way to prevent the message was by blocking Google entirely.According to The Guardian, Google’s move to drop the message is a signal that they have quietly conceded defeat in its fight to provide users with full, uncensored results. The source that they spoke to in China described continuing with the message was “counterproductive”, and that a spokesperson from the search engine confirmed the removal of the notification, but refused to provide further comment due to the sensitive nature of the topic.Exactly what it means is still open for debate.

It’s big news but no surprise to see. To me there are two obvious reasons for this.1. Major eCommerce sites don’t like to be price-compared to other small Taobao shops via eTao. The high operating expense of major eCommerce sites, and their sourced products of legitimate brands make their products less competitive in price than those sold on small Taobao shops. Consequently, they dislike the current mechanism of eTao which sequences search results based on price (from low to high and from high to low), sales volume (from high to low) and default (more research will be done to find out more about the default mechanism).As the competitive advantages of 360Buy and Dangdang lie in its own brand and merchandise quality guarantee, eTao with price sequence criteria won’t contribute the visitors to them. While the mechanism of sequencing by sales volume, doesn’t work with 360Buy and Dangdang, which opposite to Taobao shops behavior, don’t disclose the sales volume of each individual product on page. Unless eTao adds the comments volume as one more sequence criteria, 360Buy and Dangdang won’t benefit from eTao.2. eCommerce sites don’t like their original content being stolen by search engines.Both 360Buy and Dangdang are trying hard to get their customers to leave comments on their merchandise to improve trustworthiness. According to Mr. Liu Qiangdong, the CEO of 360Buy, they spent 200 million RMB, either on gifts, points collected or discounts, to encourage their customers to comment on products after they bought them. eTao’s behavior of sending its spider to crawl the comments and display them on its search results page is nothing but theft.It is interesting to see similar disputes happening again between strong content providers and new search engines. If you remember I recently wrote about the fact that vertical travel search engine Qunar was sued by Ctrip for stealing comments generated by Ctrip users. For strong eCommerce sites like 360Buy and Dangdang, traffic is not a concern so getting presence on eTao and driving visitors from there is not a priority for them. On the contrary with Taobao being a major competitor, 360Buy and Dangdang prefer not to cooperate by getting indexed by eTao, a product considered owned by Taobao, though eTao has been running independently for a while.Opportunity for OthersI believe the above situation could represent a market opportunity for international eCommerce companies to explore. With the absence of major local competitors, the “inventory” of eTao (here refers the opportunity to get more presence on eTao when querying the same keywords as thousands of product pages of 360Buy and Dangdang are no longer competing) is more available.Therefore, I predict no additional eCommerce sites will follow the moves of 360Buy, DangDang, and Suning unless they are big enough and don’t wish to get any traffic from eTao.Tags: 360Buy, China, DangDang, E-Commerce, eTao, Suning, TaobaoCategory: E-commerce, E-commerce China','article'),(3881,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/dangdang/','DangDang - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Major eCommerce Sites Have Blocked the eTao Spider – Why and What Next Recently, major China eCommerce sites; at the beginning 360Buy, then Dangdang and Suning have blocked the eTao spider from crawling and indexing their websites. eTao is the eCommerce product search engine owned by Taobao, China’s largest eCommerce site.

The tool is quite simple, and it is more like a SEO scoring system using 100 as the highest score. It will evaluate websites from 6 different aspects. They are: URL length, parameters in the URL, completion of meta keywords and meta description, frames, text description for flash, and image ALT tags.All the aspects for this scoring system are all related to onsite SEO. Content relevancy and link profiles are not covered in this tool. Hopefully Baidu will keep updating this tool to provide us more comprehensive features to check website SEO performance in the future. Here are some more explanations given by Baidu in relation to these 6 aspects.URL length: Baidu suggests the URL better be less than 255 characters.Parameters in URL: Using parameters in the URL might cause the spider to crawl the page repeatedly.Completion of Meta Tags: the absence of meta descriptions and keywords might affect the presentation of the results and rankings. (Today, most of us will even leave meta keywords empty as we all believe it has almost no influence on rankings. But Baidu still suggests the completion of meta descriptions and keywords is important. This is a quite interesting point.)Frame: Using frames will cause crawling difficulty for the Baidu spider. It is better not to use frames.Flash text description: Will help Baidu to better understand the flash content.Image ALT tag: Having ALT tags for images will help with image indexation.At the moment, this “SEO Suggestion” tool requires an invitation code. The invitation code can be obtained from 1) your PPC agent, if you are paying for Baidu PPC. 2) redeeming it by points, if you are a member of Baidu Union. 3) email your application to bang@baidu.com , using “申请SEO建议” as the subject providing your website details, your baidu tongji username, email and phone number.Reference:http://yingxiao.baidu.com/support/topic/43/Tags: Analytics, Baidu, Baidu Tongji, China, Onsite Optimization, SEO SuggestionCategory: Analytics, Analytics China','article'),(3887,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/seo-suggestion/','SEO Suggestion - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Baidu Tongji introduces its new function SEO Suggestion At the end of June 2011, Baidu introduced the new tool “SEO Suggestion” in its web analytics platform Baidu Tongji.

Its popularity among Chinese webmasters may make outsiders wonder how great it can be compared with Google Analytics, which is free and popular too.IP & Page View OrientedStarting from its birth, CNZZ has been used by the medium and small webmasters, who own websites with limited traffic and try to sell advertisers with Page Views, hence the traffic or IP address and Page Views are the key indicators of the website performance. The tool was developed based on the two major metrics, on which webmasters keep their eyes 24/7.With limited traffic, Webmasters spend much time in tracking and understanding the individual visitors via CNZZ to find out how many times the IP visits the site, when was the first time it visits, and via which source it arrived to the site, etc. This information is insightful if you want to understand specific visitors, however it will become too bulky to go through each log when your site accumulates tens of thousands of visitors, and a multi-dimensional web analytics tool that can segment the data through different metrics will be much more powerful.Single-dimensional MetricsMost metrics that CNZZ use are single dimensional, which means you can hardly do data mining with a group of metrics. The only 2 dimensional metrics it supports are Search Engines with Keywords, Visitor’s Territory with and Visitor’s ISP. The former function is very useful in fulfilling the basic needs of any webmasters doing SEO, however it is also very common as most web analytics tools support that too. The latter one is not that much value to do data-mining with ISP as metrics.Real-time DataThe most recent data you can get from CNZZ is from 15 minutes earlier. This is a legacy from when the tool was developed, i.e. to meet the needs of the grass root webmasters, who spent a lot of time in monitoring the limited data, and wanted to know what is happening with their traffic so as to take action within the day. This is a big plus for CNZZ, considering Google Analytics provides data from 24 hours earlier.Obviously CNZZ is not powerful as Google Analytics when it comes to data-mining, but it does have certain beauties that go along with Chinese webmaster user behavior. After the acquisition by Alibaba, funds will be pumped into the company, and functionality will surely be improved.Tags: Alibaba, Analytics, China, CNZZCategory: Analytics, Analytics China','article'),(3890,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/analytics-china/using-google-analytics-in-china-adding-support-for-chinese-search-engines/','Using Google Analytics in China – Adding Support for Chinese Search Engines','','An explanation of how to adapt the coding to use Google Analytics on the various serach engines in China including SOSO, Sogou, and Youdao.','Web analytics is a useful tool to evaluate a website’s SEO effectiveness. When it comes to web analytics packages, many will choose Google Analytics because it covers the basics, is continuously getting improved upon and best of all, it’s free.By default Google Analytics can recognise organic traffic from major search engines worldwide, and you can check their list of support search engines for details. However, lesser search engines are not supported by default and traffic gets recorded as regular referral instead. As we have seen from China’s search engine market share, it is a good idea to keep a close eye on the lesser search engines, as Google’s second place influence has been in continuous decline ever since their service was re-routed to their Hong Kong site last year, and local operators are no doubt hoping to one day take over.You can tell Google Analytics to track and recognize organic traffic from additional search engines by tweaking the tracking code you use on your sites. This is done through adding a few lines using the addOrganic method. Below we will show how to add support for SOSO, Sogou and Youdao, the three strongest search engines after Baidu and Google, for both the asynchronous tracking code and the synchronous version. You should choose to follow the version that you are currently using, and replace “UA-XXXXXX-X” with your profile ID.Simply add lines 5-7 to your tracking code as demonstrated below for a standard asynchronous setup.

Considering Google bought Urchin in 2005 and Baidu launched its own web analytics tool called Baidu Tongji in 2007, it’s not a surprise for Alibaba to do so. Although Alibaba’s Taobao has Quantum Statistics (量子统计) adopted by all Taobao shop owners to optimize their sites, it doesn’t know much when it is out of Taobao territory.CNZZ, on the contrary, is very strong in the small independent website world. It has been offering free web analytics tools to many small webmasters owned by individuals since its founding and slowly certain sites grew big while still using it; including hoopchina.com, admin5.com and Verycd.com. According to W3Techs, CNZZ is used by 4.3% of all the websites whose traffic analysis tool they know, which is 2.7% of all websites.The real beauty that Alibaba perceives in CNZZ is its huge number users of independent webmasters, as CNZZ claims that 3.06 million websites are using its analytics and it is monitoring 5 billion page views daily.In the affiliate marketing field, Alibaba’s Alimama is behind Baidu Union and Google Adsense. One important reason is it doesn’t have the same unified web analytics tool for all the websites that its content network includes, as its competitors do. Hence it cannot provide a clear and convincing user behavior report when advertisers have doubts about the small websites where their ads will be placed. By taking over CNZZ and recruiting the small independent webmasters into the network, Alimama will be in a much better position when dealing with online advertisers.In addition, many small and medium eCommerce sites, especially those Groupon clones, are using the CNZZ tool too. With CNZZ under its umbrella, Alibaba can access online shoppers’ behaviors not only in Taobao, but also non -Taobao eCommerce platforms.If you notice that Alibaba’s eCommerce search engine Etao started to index non-Taobao eCommerce sites recently, it’s not difficult to understand Jack Ma’s strategic movement by acquiring CNZZ – that is to use the statistics to optimize its Etao algorithm and fit into online shoppers needs better. If Baidu has seen the threats in the areas of affiliate marketing and eCommerce search, actions will be taken soon.Tags: Alibaba, Analytics, Baidu, China, CNZZ, TaobaoCategory: Analytics, Analytics China','article'),(3894,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/ppc-china/rich-media-ads-vs-ppc/','Rich Media Ads VS PPC','','An analysis of the growing use of rich media ads versus the use of PPC in search engines such as Baidu and Google and the consumer and advertising benefits which can be gained from the use of new advertising technologies.','In the early stage of the Internet, most advertisements were Banner ads shown as words and flat pictures on the network. They passed direct stimulation to the audience. The information transmission of text image ads is simple and straightforward. The required network traffic is small and it’s loved by advertisers. PPC also belongs to this type of advertising. It passes product information through simple text, as shown below.Rich media ads show product features in flash or other media forms. They integrate a large number of programming techniques, which is a characteristic of rich media ads. In the form of a short video, advertising expression is more abundant. And they also can interact with the audience which attracts the attention of the audience. At the same time, they more fully demonstrate the attractiveness of the product. The demand for network bandwidth for rich media ads is certainly higher than the text image ads. When observing the network situation now, it would seem that the bandwidth of network users can fully meet the demand for rich media ads.Baidu’s Hong Media is a new precise display advertising network designed for the promotion of products and brands in China. Hong Media works well with most major media. It will show a relevant rich media ad, according to what the visitor is viewing. The ad is shown in the lower right corner of the webpage (sample as the below). Different to the other rich media ads, at the bottom of this advertising window there is a Baidu search box containing the keyword for the brand in the advertisement. If the visitor holds the cursor on the media and clicks the mouse, it will immediately enter the ad owner’s website. If the visitor holds the cursor on the search box and clicks, it will go to Baidu with the search results of the advertiser’s brand. By integrating rich media ads into search engine results, it not only increases advertising revenue, but also brings more traffic to Baidu. And then there is more opportunity to showcase Baidu’s PPC content, which can generate more advertising revenue again.At the same time, Google has also began working on rich media advertising. Google’s advertising system AdSense has had incorporated the function of showing pay-per-click video ads. Ad owners release ads through AdSense. And in a recent news conference, the vice president of Google search products and user experience department, Marissa Mayer, hinted that Google’s search results will also include video ads.Baidu and Google are taking two different approaches to the use of rich media advertising. I think Baidu’s method is better. Both Google’s and Baidu’s ads are targeted, however Baidu will display advertising which relates to the content of pages viewed by the viewer. And it will take part of the traffic back to Baidu. As a result, Baidu both can increase its influence and traffic; while at the same time getting revenue from advertisers, to kill two birds with one stone. Google only exists as an intermediary. The advertisers display ads on Google’s partner sites. This has no effect on Google traffic.While rich media advertising has many benefits, there is still a very large amount of search engine users, so the use of regular PPC ads will not be shaken in the short term. We note that Google’s search results may include video ads. Does this indicate that Google will merge PPC and rich media ads?Rich media is good for the viewers and cannot be ignored. What will Baidu and Google will do next to face this situation? Let us wait and see.Reference：百度鸿媒体：让品牌广告精准又精彩Doubleclick Ad Exchange 上线，Google 再整合富媒体广告进军富媒体领域: Google 测试视频AdSense You might also like \"); } function getTags(){ var result = new Array(); var tags = jQuery(\'a[rel=tag]\'); tags.each(function(index, val) { result.push(jQuery(this).text()); }); return result; } function getCats(){ var result = new Array(); var cats = jQuery(\'a[rel~=category]\'); cats.each(function(index, val) { result.push(jQuery(this).text()); }); return result; } //]]>--> Tags: Baidu, Baidu Hong Media, China, PPC, rich media ads, Search Engine Marketing, SEMCategory: PPC, PPC China','article'),(3895,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/cresty-li/','Cresty Li - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Increasing Mobile Phone Usage Makes Voice Search Imperative With the decline in the cost of smart phones, it’s not an exaggeration to say that almost everyone owns one.

One of them was complaining that the big FMCG brands are too full of themselves to deal with, and the other was saying that he had spent 12 months following up a travel sector client and had only won a tiny project. I can’t help but remembering my old days approaching the clinic clients, when one prospect told me that their daily Baidu SEM budget was RMB 60K-70K. What a goldmine these sales guys have missed when they are busy chasing the big brands!In fact healthcare has always been the top revenue generator for Baidu, leaving big budget holders like the travel, education and eCommerce sectors far behind. The Healthcare sector loves Search Engine Marketing because the essence of healthcare requires its customers to imitate the interaction, while the search engine’s mechanism of search query and display is the best channel. Second, for certain healthcare categories that require privacy protection, like sex-related issues, teenage pregnancy and plastic surgery, search engines provide patients with a secure channel to find and communicate with experts online without getting embarrassed having a face-to-face meeting with a doctor. Third, China deregulated the healthcare/clinic sector in the 1990s, which spawned a large number of private clinics. Compared with public hospitals, the private clinics are smaller and less well known, however are much more agile and aggressive in advertising spending. When they discover the benefits of Baidu SEM in generating online enquiries, and leverage it as a competitive advantage against public hospitals which tend to have no ad budgets, their SEM budget ends up doubling every month.You might wonder why this isn’t already common knowledge. Regulation is the reason that the clinics and Baidu retain a low profile in respect of the amount of SEM being used. Healthcare advertising has always been considered a sensitive issue, especially when it comes to prescription drugs and surgery and treatment, which are usually banned from promotion by the authorities. This also explains why Baidu doesn’t provide research data on the healthcare sector, while it does provide lots of search data on the travel, education, finance and gaming sectors, which can be found in data.baidu.com.However, even without search data support, Baidu’s SEM sales to the healthcare sector are still growing strong, as Search Engine Marketing advertisements still go by keywords, which makes it difficult for regulators to define whether it’s legal or not, as they need to check each advertisement on a case by case basis to find out. On the other hand, Baidu is reluctant to be strict with those ads on the border of violating the rules, which would obviously dilute its overall sales volume, profits and their performance on Nasdaq.This positive situation for Baidu continued with the Cost per Click (CPC) for the keyword ‘Best Male Hospital in Beijing” rising as high as 800 RMB until CCTV revealed that Baidu was allowing fake drugs to be advertised using SEM. Accordingly, Baidu’s Sales Department has attempted to redeem itself by changing its policy and by blacklisting more than 1,000 keywords, including cancer, hypertension, diabetes, the names of several sexually transmitted diseases, and treatment-related terms such as ‘prescription’ and ‘cure’. It also banned medical practices dealing with pregnancy, abortion, etc from SEM sales.This action by Baidu has impacted clinics a lot and many of them have changed their strategy to use more SEO, though it won’t cover their loss from SEM in the short run. This action also gives the big healthcare brands an opportunity to gain, simply by following the steps of clinics in focusing on SEO and providing customers with higher quality products, better website content and more professional online consultation. So there are significant opportunities arising for SEO practitioners to target the Healthcare industry in China as a potentially lucrative source of revenue growth going forward.Tags: Baidu, China, Healthcare, PPC, Search Engine Marketing, SEM, SEOCategory: PPC, PPC China, SEO, SEO China','article'),(3901,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/healthcare/','Healthcare - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' The Largest Invisible Baidu Patron – HealthCare in China A couple days ago, I was having a chat with several sales guys from the digital marketing industry.

But Google seems to be more popular as the second choice for those who will use search engines other than Baidu. So targeting both Baidu and Google is still a good strategy to go into China.Looking at the search habits of these users, searches on search engines are still in first place with 81%. However, it is interesting to see 39.6% of users will choose to type the keywords in browsers to search. 34.2% of users will use the search box on popular directory sites to search, and 31.4% of users will use the search box on the browser tool bar.

The search tools, which used to be on the left side of the result pages, are now at the top. This redesign opens up more space for the results in general and the knowledge graph/Google+ results on the right hand side.The next image shows an example of the second change relating to Google+ results. This section is either reserved for the knowledge graph for searches of informative nature, or for the Google+ page for searches on businesses or brands.The Google+ graph gives a short introduction of the profile with the most important facts and snippets of the latest posts made on the profile.Yahoo!Japan Renewing Their Real-time Result PageAfter the latest integration of Facebook in the real-time search results, Yahoo! Japan seems to have decided to implement some more updates and improvements for the real-time search category.This time, the desktop version as well as the mobile version experienced some major updates regarding user experience and design. SERP structure and elements were replaced or redesigned. The keyword graph is now on the top right and above the current hot topic keyword terms.Older search results are now loaded by just scrolling down, and therefore work the same way as on Twitter.The design of the tool bar on the top also changed and buttons were replaced with drop down menus to make it look cleaner.The user interface for the mobile version went through an even bigger makeover with a new design of the SERP and a new navigation menu.Yahoo! Japan announced that these changes are just the beginning and that further updates and improvement in regards to user experience are going to be made in future.Tags: Google Japan, SEO in Japan, Yahoo JapanCategory: SEO, SEO Japan','article'),(3931,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/seo-japan/the-latest-google-algorithm-updates-in-japan/','The Latest Google Algorithm Updates in Japan','','In July this year, Google Japan started to implement the Panda algorithm update for Japanese search results.

The Panda updated was implemented for English and some other languages at the beginning of 2011 already and it took almost 18 months until this update came into effect for Japan.This time, however, it seems that Google did not wait that long for the next update on the ongoing fight against bad quality content in the SERPs. Very recently, Google Japan posted on its official Google Webmaster Central Blog saying that this update is another step forward in Google’s continuous efforts in providing unique content and better user experience.Japanese users complained that sites with good content were pushed down by low-quality sites, which only consist of content copied from other sources. The latest update represents Google’s answer to these complaints.After the last update in July affected around 4% of all search results in Japanese, this time it will influence around 5% of all results, which should have a considerable impact on the Japanese SEO landscape.However, Google also emphasises that affiliate sites with little or no original and compelling content, or duplicate content sites violating Webmaster Guidelines are not directly affected by this update.These kinds of issues are already long known violations of Google’s Webmaster Guidelines and had therefore been coped with way before this latest update.Tags: Google Algorithm Japan, Google Japan, Japan, Panda Update JapanCategory: SEO, SEO Japan','article'),(3933,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/google-algorithm-japan/','Google Algorithm Japan - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' The Latest Google Algorithm Updates in Japan In July this year, Google Japan started to implement the Panda algorithm update for Japanese search results.

Japan and Google Search Partnership','','The integration of Google\'s search engine into Yahoo Japan\'s portal is complete. This blog discusses the implications for SEO in the Japan Market...','As I have previously mentioned in an earlier post the integration of Google search results into Yahoo! Japan seems to have been completed. The image below depicts a particular search term with the Google results on the left and Yahoo! Japan results on the right hand side. Japanese SEO’s will be interested to note that the results on both sites show a perfect match.As further confirmation that the integration may now be complete, Yahoo used to show “Search Results provided by Yahoo! Inc.” in the footer of its search result listings, however that has now been removed as can be seen from the below listings.BEFORE:AFTER:Even though the above results do show a perfect match, Yahoo has previously stated they will customize their search results to meet individual user preferences and such search results would be different from those presented by Google. Perhaps they were referring to the shopping section of their search results. For example, if you search for “Digital Camera” in both Google and Yahoo!, for Google they will have Google Shopping listed in their search results and for Yahoo!, Yahoo! Auctions will be displayed. Even though the integration seems to be complete, neither Google nor Yahoo! Japan have confirmed this.Implications for SEO in JapanThe result of the integration is that Google now has more than 90% of the search market in Japan, and for natural search results on Yahoo! Japan, the results generated will be powered by Google. Therefore, Japanese SEO has become a lot easier in that you only really need to do optimization for Google’s search algorithm. On the flip-side, make sure you use legitimate SEO methods as any penalty on Google in Japan will cost you dearly in ranking performance, as Yahoo! Japan is no longer the dominant search results provider.Tags: Google, Google Japan, Japan, SEO, Yahoo JapanCategory: SEO, SEO Japan','article'),(3937,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/google-japan/page/2/','Google Japan - 2/2 - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' The Introduction of Google Shopping in Japan Google Japan recently announced its new feature “Google Shopping” that could increase their e-commerce market share in Japan.

Many people will know that Alibaba also owns Taobao which is a straight e-commerce site like Ebay.In November 2010, Etao launched its Open Search Beta service by integrating other B2C website data in addition to Taobao.com. To protect its user member’s interests, the following criteria must be met in order for data to be incorporated.1. Top 3 B2C eCommerce websites in the vertical industry.2. Stable and varied logistics channels, plus strong warehousing capabilities3. Good after sales service team, better with 400 / 800 pre dial hotline number4. Providing quality goodsSince this launch, a couple of medium B2C E-Commerce sites have been invited to submit to the Etao search engine, with users slowly now getting search results from domains other than Taobao.com. Since March 9th 2011, Etao officially indexed some big B2C eCommerce websites, including 360Buy, Vancl and Dangdang. It’s a great step for Etao, because without indexing content from these big 3 B2C websites, Etao cannot call itself an E-Commerce search engine. Just like you cannot imagine search on Baidu without news from Sina, Sohu and Netease.Etao is still in its infancy, and its Alexa ranking in China is 617, which is nothing compared to Baidu’s No. 1, Soso’s No. 9 and Sogou’s No.16. Therefore Dangdang, 360Buy and Vancl cannot expect to get much from Etao at the moment, whether in terms of traffic or sales. Rather, it’s a strategic decision to get a footstep in the first E-Commerce search engine in China, which hopefully will ultimately bring rewards.I believe that under the umbrella of the Alibaba Group and in cooperation with Microsoft Bing in China, Etao’s growth can be unlimited. In addition, the big 3 China E-Commerce sites might also get traffic or sales from Taobao, once Taobao aligns its internal search engine algorithm with Etao’s new change, as Taobao Search has already integrated information from Etao since November 2010. The purpose is to add product specifications, forums, Q&A’s and news along with the products displayed on Taobao’s search results, so as to make the offers more concrete and informative to customers.Whether Taobao ends up partially cannibalizing itself by diverting its members to other non-Taobao websites will depend on how Taobao positions itself, i.e. as closed kingdom or an open platform. We will see how it develops in the near future.Tags: 360Buy, Alibaba, B2C, China, DangDang, E-Commerce, Ebay, eTao, Taobao, VanclCategory: E-commerce, E-commerce China','article'),(3949,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/b2c/','B2C - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Etao Open Search Indexes Dangdang, 360Buy and Vancl As my colleague Richard wrote about some time ago, Etao is a relatively new e-commerce search engine in China which has been launched by Taobao.

At its inception, Cuil looked pretty good on paper. The VCs thought so too, investing $33 million in the company. The broad experience of the management team, which included ex-Googlers and IBM executives and their alternative approach to search had many believing Cuil could succeed in providing an alternative to Google.So why did Cuil fail? Many reasons contributed to its lack of success but one truth is universal: in order to take market share from a giant in any market, the alternative proposition has to offer the consumer a real difference from what they already have without any drawbacks. Cuil did offer a true alternative in user interface. However, it fell down in one key area. Despite having the money and the team and the ‘Cuil’ interface, it was unable to beat or even equal Google in its core competency of providing relevant search results.State of PlayWith Yahoo no longer having its own search engine and Cuil shutting down, the search market in the United States is consolidating. Likely only two search engines will be left. In contrast, the China market is moving in the opposite direction. Baidu currently holds around 70 percent market share and this seems to be on the rise. Google has just over 24 percent and others including Sogou, Soso, and Youdao have around 6 percent combined.Me TooWith a search market worth an estimated $471 million and Baidu’s stock price continuing to increase, it is no surprise that more companies want in, even though the market is looking rather crowded. The ‘me too’ model has worked well for many companies in China in the past but any company coming in now will not be taking on an ill prepared foreign company feeling its way. Baidu is well funded, local, and massively dominant. So how do these companies expect to offer something that will gain market share? Is a small share of the massive China market enough? How many niches are there to exploit?Are We ‘Cuil’?Foreign companies have had their fair share of problems navigating the China market, frequently butting heads with the Chinese government. Google’s issues have been reported to death so I won’t cover them here, but it is certainly not alone. Microsoft is one foreign company that has been in China for some time and appears to understand it better than most. Of course, its interests are larger than just the search market, but from being nowhere with “Bing” it has been quietly plugging away furthering relationships and avoiding confrontations. For all its work, it has been rewarded in a number of ways. It is collaborating with Alibaba on its internal search tool 1688 and is now providing the organic search results for Taobao’s new ‘search engine’ Etao.com. More on that below.****UPDATE*** Bing is no longer providing organic search results to Etao.com and has been replaced by sogou.comE-Commerce Search Battle BeginsIn October, Taobao launched its own search engine called etao.com with interface as depicted below. Organic search results are available and powered by Bing but they are not in any position of prominence. Most of the results that appear at the top of the page relate to e-commerce. These e-commerce results come from Taobao itself. The main reason for Etao to exist is for e-commerce search and not to take on Baidu directly as a regular search engine.Rather than challenging Baidu, the creation of Etao is Taobao’s move to defend itself. In 2008, Baidu was fast becoming the main place for e-commerce search. When looking for consumer items, many organic results found on Baidu were coming from Taobao. No doubt, this was risky for Taobao. Baidu could easily start its own e-commerce site and divert traffic overnight to its new property. In a preemptive move, Taobao blocked Baidu’s robots from indexing its website. This essentially forced customers searching for consumer items to visit Taobao directly. However, Taobao mostly focused on content inside the site. It does not really provide all of the elements one would expect from a real search engine such as access to comparison sites, forums, and other useful resources needed when making a purchase. The newly launched Etao does.Baidu took time to get into the e-commerce space but now it has arrived. The joint venture announced with Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten means the resulting ‘RakuBai’ will compete head on with Taobao.***UPDATE***What’s the Bottom Line?There many other developments in the search engine scene in China of interest to practioners of Chinese SEO, but I will cover them another time.

However it is hard to monetize these kinds of search engines.Successful vertical search engines in China include Qunar in travel, Aibang in local and BTChina in Bit Torrent download. However, none of them have had a smooth life. Qunar and Aibang were sued by other websites for violating copyright, and BTChina was forced to shut down because it leads huge traffic to different websites offering pirated movies/music downloading.In the travel ecosystem, Qunar makes a living by charging a commission on traffic or orders it provides to travel portals, Online Travel Agencies (“OTA”), and websites of branded hotels and airlines. Since it has strong price comparison capabilities, by indexing pricing info from OTA websites, and also as it has a user friendly interface and search engine friendly website structure, it has overtaken the leading positions of Citrip and Elong and Mangocity in the online travel market.Unlike Qunar’s business model, these traditionally strong OTA’s had spent huge amounts of time and energy in partnering with a large number of hotels, airlines and tourist spots, and hosting their own transaction platform, via which tourists book their itineraries. In addition, to retain the visitors they create a lot of content, and provide a UGC (User Generated Content) channel for tourists to post pictures, comments and collect points for discounts. So when Qunar takes traffic away from OTA’s by committing themselves to more SEO efforts, and then goes back to them and asks for commission for providing traffic, the OTA’s actually consider Qunar a competitor rather than a partner. As an example, when Citrip discovered Qunar indexed content, including pictures and users’ comments on hotels they stayed in before, Ctrip actually looked for compensation from Qunar for violating copyright.Comments play an important role in influencing consumer purchase decision making. Without creating their own content continuously, vertical search engines need to depend on robots to crawl others’ content. That’s why the same situation happened with Aibang, a local vertical search engine.When Aibang local search indexes comments from other websites regarding local restaurants, night clubs or KTV (from which it gets advertising fees), the result is more appealing to consumers. Accordingly, since Aibang was taking information from other websites, it got into danger of litigation from those websites which consider it a competitor rather than a traffic bringer. Dianping in Chinese means commenting, and it started business by giving registered individual users discounts for using its business services in 2003, and offered individual deeper discount rates when they accumulated more comments or shared more details regarding their purchasing experiences. So when Dianping became the biggest commenting portal and retained hundreds of millions of users, they no longer care about getting traffic from Aibang. Instead Dianping considers it a competitor, and they sued Aibang for copying Dianping users created content in 2008 and again in 2010.Also a problem for vertical search engines, in addition to content partner creation problems, is that the universal search engines, including Google and Baidu are trying to integrate niche search engines. For example, GoogleCN launched local search in 2005, and Baidu launched commenting service called Shenbian in Nov. 2010. The future for vertical search engines looks dim, if they don’t overcome the content issues described above.Tags: Aibang, ChemIndex, China, Citrip, Kdccc, Qunar, SEO, Vertical Search EnginesCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(3959,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/aibang/','Aibang - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Vertical Search Engines Awkward Situation in China Differing from universal search engines, like Google and Baidu, vertical search engines focus on a specific segment of online content, by sending crawlers to index only Web pages that are relevant to a pre-defined topic or set of topics.

The search portal giant has enjoyed 70% of the SEM market share since 2011, and in 2012 recorded the highest PPC revenue in history.Not complacent to bite the dust, competitors Daum and Microsoft had already started a search alliance in the organic search field in 2009, the same year that Bing decided to show Daum search results in its SERPS (see screenshot below).Bing has now expressed further commitment to cooperation with Daum, and April is seeing this alliance progress a step further into the PPC realm. Both portals have the shared goal of tackling the near- monopolistic search engine landscape in Korea.However, it is not just Microsoft and Bing looking to join forces to remain competitive in Korea, additional internet platforms in the region such as SK Telekom’s Nate and Zum are already paving alliances with Daum for paid searches; with all platforms currently displaying adverts pulled from Daum’s advertising platform.All four search platforms combined have a search engine market share of approximately 18%, and Daum has voiced an ambition to increase its current advertising clientele of 190,000 to 230,000 in order to challenge Naver’s current number of 260,000.However, it remains to be seen whether forging industry alliances will materialize to keep the Korean search engine market competitive.

With such a miniscule share of the Korean search market (2%), it seems as if Google has yet to put its best effort into the Korea market, but the increasing importance of mobile search and the rise in prominence of their Android mobile operating system may be making Google take a second look at this small, yet valuable Asian market.Now, with executive chairman Eric Schmidt’s recent visit last month, speculation is circling around the possibility of Google purchasing Korea’s second most popular search engine portal, Daum. Let’s take a look at the current situation of Google Korea and recent developments over the past year to see how these factors may have influenced this possible decision.As the far and away leader in the global search market, Google isn’t exactly used to be being the underdog. Due to dominance in the Korean market by local portals, Naver and Daum (occupying a 70% and 12% market share respectively), Google struggles to maintain a wimpy 2% of all Korean searches.So why is it that Google, synonymous with search in most parts of the globe, is so insignificant in Korea? Cultural differences in search habits account for the majority of the reason behind Google’s failure to catch on in Korea. Whereas internet portals in the West went the way of the dodo as improvements in search algorithms made search results more relevant, they continue to be the preferred medium to access content throughout Korea and other parts of Asia.As we’ve mentioned in earlier posts, Korean searchers rely on portals to tell them what content they’re looking for, rather than the searcher telling the portal what they’re looking for. This can be demonstrated by a taking a look at a search engine results page (SERP) on Naver or Daum. Paid ads, as well as content from the portal’s own products make up the lion’s share of results, while natural search results are pushed far, far down the page. (My scroll wheel finger hurts…)Even though Google, breaking with its usual simplicity of their other global properties, has adopted an approach much more along the lines of the other portal leaders, analysts believe that they have still failed to ‘get’ the Korean audience. Google’s focus on natural search results has been deemed “not appropriate for Korean search culture” by many searchers.As if getting consistently beaten up in the marketplace wasn’t enough, in May of this year, Google’s Seoul office wasraided by Korean authorities after accusations that their mobile advertising platform, Admob, illegally collected location data of its users without consent.While Google wasn’t the only search provider affected by the probe, (Daum’s offices were raided as well under the same suspicions), nor was Korea the only government to look into such concerns (similar accusations have been made in several countries throughout the world, including the US, the UK, and France), these allegations certainly weren’t helping Google’s PR in Korea.Last week, Google was cleared of charges, ruling that while the company did collect location data from its users, this information was stored anonymously and could not be used to identify individual users.Only a few months after the first probe, Google’s offices were raided yet again in September, this time in response to accusations of anticompetitive practices in their Android operating system. Competitors Naver and Daum alleged that Google banned South Korean phone manufacturers from including third-party search applications on their devices, and delayed certifying handset makers that did otherwise. Once again, another issue non-exclusive to Korea, but these accusations served as another kick to Google’s side while it was down.With all these troubles Google has been having, it’s no wonder Google could be looking for a way to gain a greater foothold in the attractive Korean market. During Eric Schmidt’s visit to South Korea last month, rumors of a potential purchase of Daum by Google circulated around the internet, fueled by a statement by Google officials stressing that Schmidt’s visit was more than just a “diplomatic gesture”, and Google’s investment will be “large and substantial”.Google already maintains a partnership with Daum, powering paid ads on the site since 2007. With this pre-established relationship already on the books, is a complete takeover the logical next step?The buyout looks like it could be a win-win situation for both parties. Google would bring its unrivaled search algorithm and processing power, while Daum could provide cultural insight in addition to access to their line of products and mountains of valuable content.Not only would a Google buyout increase the quality of their services, but it would finally start to close the gap between them and leader, Naver. Even with Google’s expanded market share growing to 14%, Naver would still find itself in a comfortably dominant position. However, the purchase would be symbolic of a renewed effort in Korea by Google — one that may turn Naver’s head and keep them wondering what they have up their sleeves next.A month after Schmidt’s visit, rumors of the purchase have quieted a bit. Even if Google made a bid to purchase the internet portal, analysts are skeptical about the chances that a deal would go through, given the protectionist business environment in Korea. Still, there’s no doubt that such an acquisition would cause quite a stir in the Korean search market and create a small crack in Naver’s dominance of the region.Tags: Daum, Google, Google / Daum Partnership, Google Korea, Korea, Naver, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Korea','article'),(3979,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/simon/','Simon Lesser - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Google Korea: We are the 2 Percent Could a Google / Daum Partnership End Google’s Korea Woes?

Unlike many of the countries with big internet markets, the main Korean search engines are local platforms, Naver and Daum. Naver and Daum take up more than 90 percent share in the Korean search engine market. The world’s biggest and most renowned search engine, Google, only takes up about 2 percent of the market share.Korea, with the 12th largest pool of internet users was among the first countries to receive internet connections which makes it not surprising that a lot of foreign companies want to enter the Korean market and consider Korean SEO strategies. The search culture and the user patterns of the Koreans are very different from others.Korean internet users, much like their western counterparts, tend to look at items towards the top of the results pages and are less likely to click on anything below the fold. Organic results on both Daum and Naver appear far down the page. In fact you need to scroll down the page to find them. This explains why Korean SEO has not really been that effective in the past with the only solution in gaining visibility on Korean search engines being to do paid search.Let’s take a closer look at the 3 search engines that make up the search market in South Korea.With a market share of 81%, Naver is the undisputed and most dominating search engine in South Korea. Most well known for its Q & A platform, Naver offers results within a wide range of categories including blogs, cafés (foreign equivalent of forum), videos, dictionaries, images, and books. Different from foreign search engines like Google and Yahoo, Naver’s rankings are not influenced by classic link-building, but on-site optimization and building links from Naver properties such as blogs does work as a strategy for Naver SEO.Daum is the second most-used search engine in South Korea and holds about 12% of the search engine market. It was one of the earliest portal sites before Naver to provide services like e-mail and social networking platforms called café. Although still visited by many users, more people prefer to perform their searches on Naver than Daum. Without a doubt, Daum’s biggest competitor, in terms of market share and presence, is Naver. Daum is not as quick as Naver or Google Korea to index new content and it does take some time to respond to SEO activities. Onsite optimization and building links from other Daum properties does work in getting higher rankings although Daum is hard to predict. Building Links from outside Korea has little or no impact from our experience.Though Naver surely is a dominant search engine in the Korean market, the introduction of Google Instant may finally improve Google’s position in the market. However, it still is a long way or may even be impossible for Google to overcome the high walls built over so many years by Naver and Daum.Google surely is the most trusted and influential search engine in the world. However, Google only takes up about 2% of the market in Korea. It does not discriminate the language that the keyword is in, whereas Naver and Daum do not show results if the keyword is in English. Compared to these local search engines Naver and Daum, Google Korea has far less paid ads on the results page and shows mostly organic results.This approach has been criticized as not being suitable for Korean tastes.For foreign companies who want to penetrate the Korean internet market, it is crucial that they study and fully understand these distinct differences in the market and Korea’s web system that remains unique from most of the countries in the world.Tags: Content Writing, Daum, Google, Google Korea, Korea, Naver, Onsite Optimization, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Korea','article'),(3985,'http://www.searchblog.asia/page/6/','SEO China, SEO Japan, SEO Korea : Search insights from Asia  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Baidu and 360 Sou announce 100% fraud protection programs Baidu and 360 Sou have announced bold changes to their consumer fraud protection programs.

On February 21, Naver officially announced and implemented the inclusion of its Opencast content as an own category into the search results of its universal SERP. Before looking into the implications for SEO in Korea, let’s first take a closer look at this new category called Opencast.What is Naver Opencast?Naver Opencast was introduced in 2008 and is very similar to a social bookmarking platform. The main goal is to share unique and great content found on the web in a compact and easily digestible way. Each registered Naver user can own an Opencast ‘publisher’ page and assign it with a title, description and tags. However, in order to become an Opencast publisher, one must go through a complicated verification process. This process can only be completed by receiving at least five recommendations by other users via an email verification system.After being verified, it is possible to start sharing links and bookmarks from the web with the help of Opencast tabs. When creating a tab a category from a preset list (e.g. travel, IT, entertainment, etc.) needs to be chosen, and a title as well as a description needs to be added. It is possible to select from different tab designs and each tab normally includes four to eight thumbnails and/or links, depending on the chosen design (see image below).Readers can then find this tab on the Opencast website next to all other tabs published by other users. The tabs are either presented in a flow view (like in the image below) or can also be displayed in a list view, and the order of appearance can be sorted by date, publisher or popularity. For further information you can take a look at the official service introduction and tutorial videos provided by Naver.Integration of Opencast in the Naver universal SERPLooking at the Naver SERP, positioning of the new Opencast category heavily depends, as for all other categories, on the keyword term. For a travel-related term we used in the screenshot below we can see that it is placed as 7th out of 17 categories.The Opencast search result section normally contains three Opencast tabs, whereas only the first one is expanded by default (see image below). Besides the shared content in the form of thumbnails and links, tab title, the first part of the tab description, and the Opencast publisher page title can be seen for the first expanded search result in this new category. You can either choose to go the publisher’s Opencast page by clicking on the tab title or directly go to the promoted content or website by clicking on the thumbnail or hyperlink below.Implications for Search Engine Optimisation on NaverThe Opencast site is equipped with its own search engine and it seems that results for the Opencast category on the Naver homepage are pulled from that search engine’s database. Some of the main ranking factors are recency, popularity and keyword usage in the title, description and tags of the publisher’s Opencast page as well as in the tabs themselves. By providing great content worth sharing, companies can try to catch the attention of popular Opencast publishers within their own industry and use this new chance of search engine visibility for increasing referral traffic from Naver.Happy to hear about your opinion on this new category or other chances on how to utilize social bookmarking for SEO in Korea!Category: Korea, SEO Korea','article'),(3988,'http://www.searchblog.asia/page/9/','SEO China, SEO Japan, SEO Korea : Search insights from Asia  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Yahoo!

For a full-page SERP snapshot, please refer below.Chinese language word searches, such as synonyms or antonyms return a much smaller footprint result, whereby the answers gathered from various dictionary sites will be presented in a boxed area.Users can even search for idioms containing specific characters, signalling that Baidu’s new search technology is not just limited to displaying meaning, but that it also offers structure.It will be interesting to witness how Baidu will expand this technology to encompass other subjects in the future.How do you think it will change user experience for the better?Tags: BaiduCategory: China, PPC China, SEO China','article'),(3997,'http://www.searchblog.asia/page/7/','SEO China, SEO Japan, SEO Korea : Search insights from Asia  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Baidu pushes out “Money Plant” algorithm update Baidu released another update to its “Money Plant”1 algorithm on Monday.

Japan Partnership','','This article examines the Yahoo Japan / Google partnership and the implications for Japanese SEO practitioners...','It has been over 3 months since Yahoo Japan announced that they will adopt Google’s search engine technology. Yahoo Japan has said it hopes to fully integrate Google’s search technology by the end of the year which will have a major impact for Japanese SEO and search engine marketers in Japan.Microsoft is opposed to the alliance in Japan and is currently in talks regarding this opposition with Japan’s Fair Trade Commission (“FTC”). Additionally, Japan’s largest online retailer, Rakuten, has just launched a petition with the FTC also opposing the alliance and has requested the FTC to review the original decision to allow it to go ahead. Assuming the deal does go ahead as planned, here are the relevant facts from an SEO perspective.The Yahoo Japan and Google partnership involves the integration into Yahoo Japan’s search platform of Google’s Web, Images, and Video Search Technologies, as well as its Mobile and Pay for Performance Technologies. Also, as Yahoo Japan announced, although they will be adopting Google’s search and advertising technology, they will customize their search results to Yahoo users and people will continue to experience a difference when searching on Yahoo compared with Google.The integration of Google’s search technology into Yahoo Japan’s portal is currently under testing with certain specified users being granted special access to the new system for testing purposes. One such privileged person is Kenichi Suzuki, an SEO specialist in Japan, who has published the following results on his blog for the generic search term “Overseas Travel”. (Image from (Kenichi Suzuki’s Blog) :The results in Fig 1 demonstrate a 100% match appearing on both Google and Yahoo Japan for the search term “Overseas Travel”.However, as Yahoo Japan has specified, they will still be intending to present results in a customized way to their users which will be different from Google’s. As the integration will be only for those 5 sections mentioned above, the integration therefore will not include maps or other localized search functions.Therefore, I believe that searches for brand keywords may well show different search results as the different localization functionalities take effect. No exact measurement of the differences can be calculated at this moment as the integration is only open to specified users as mentioned above. Below is another example from (Kenichi Suzuki’s Blog) where localized searches for a particular term continue to show their own different results on Yahoo Japan and on Google:The results for generic searches appear to be the same and those for local searches appear, at this stage at least, to be a little different. We can’t speculate about how much customization will occur as Yahoo Japan has announced will be the case, however overall I would say that the above results may well be very good for many multinational companies engaging in Japanese SEO as it would appear at this stage at least that they will be able to adopt similar optimization strategies for their websites in Japan to be deployed across both Yahoo Japan and Google.Of course, if the challenges to the alliance now coming from both Microsoft and Rakuten, about which I shall discuss in my next blog post, come to any fruition and the deal is ultimately blocked then the above conclusions may well turn out to be ineffectual. We shall have to wait and see!UPDATE- 2 Dec, 2010: The FTC has now dismissed any objections to the partnership and has now formally approved it.

It appears in two forms. One is before the search and the other after the search. Before the search looks like the picture below, i.e. when you type ‘seo’ in the search box, it has a dropdown with 10 suggested keywords.Baidu relevant search also exists after the search. Like the picture below shows, after pushing the search button when searching ‘seo’, I got a SERP (Search Engine Result Page), and at the bottom of the SERP, you can see 10 suggested relevant search terms.How does understanding Baidu Relevant Search benefit online marketers?1. Protecting your brandFor example, recently a popular blogger Luo Yonghao has been complaining about Siemens washing machines on his blog and on Sina Weibo. Now when I type Luo Yonghao (罗永浩), the fourth suggested keyword is Luo Yonghao Siemens (罗永浩 西门子). When you select the term, you will find the SERP is full of the negative content about Luo’s complaint.Hence, to defend the Siemens brand, flushing down Luo Yonghao Siemens (罗永浩 西门子) from the top ten relevant searched terms of Luo Yonghao (罗永浩) is very critical.2. Building up your termIf you want to build up your own terms by associating them with other well-known generic terms, Baidu relevant search is also a good approach.For example, say you have your own target generic brand called ‘云应用平台Cloud Application Platform’, which is not a popular term on Baidu. However, if that term becomes the relevant search term 云计算(Cloud Computing), you will benefit from the hundreds of searches per day from 云计算(Cloud computing) by getting traffic from people clicking either the dropdown in search box or suggested keywords at the bottom of the SERP (Search Engine Result Page).Baidu Relevant Search ExecutionBefore you try to associate your term with popular terms or flush out your unwanted term from Baidu relevant search, you need to understand how Baidu relevant search works technically through URL’s.1. http://www.baidu.com/s?wd=seo&rsv_bp=0&rsv_spt=3&inputT=775This is the URL of the Search Engine Result Page from searching ‘seo’.2. http://www.baidu.com/s?bs=seo&f=8&rsv_bp=1&rsv_spt=3&wd=seo+agency&inputT=17141This is the URL of the Search Engine Result Page from searching ‘seo agency’ from page 1.3. http://www.baidu.com/s?bs=seo+agency&f=3&rsv_bp=1&rsv_spt=3&wd=seo%B9%AB%CB%BE&oq=seo+&rsp=9&inputT=12604This is the URL of the Search Engine Result Page after clicking on the 9th suggested keyword – ‘seo 公司(company)’ in the dropdown of page 1’s search box.4. http://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%B1%B1%BE%A9seo%B9%AB%CB%BE&rsp=0&oq=seo%B9%AB%CB%BE&f=1&rsv_ers=xn1This is the URL of the Search Engine Result Page after clicking on the suggested keyword – ‘seo 公司(company)’ at the bottom of page 3.To help you better understand the URL’s above, please see the following explanation of the URL parameters:-s? means searchwd means current searched keywordbs means previous searched keywordrsv_bp=0 means the first time searchrsv_bp =1 means the second or more time searchrsv_spt = 3 means IE browserinputT means response time in millisecondf=8 means searched by the userf=3 means searched by selecting suggested term on the dropdown in search boxf=1 means searched by selecting suggested term on the search result pageoq=seo means the original search keyword is seorsp=9 means that this is the 9+1th relevant keyword%B9%AB%CB% means Chinese charactersIf you understand the whole mechanism, you will see that Baidu Relevant Search is based on human behavior. To be more specific, when there are more people searching for ‘seo agency’ on the Search Engine Result Page of ‘seo’, the more possible it is that Baidu will add ‘seo agency’ as a suggested keyword of ‘seo’ in either the search box dropdown or at the bottom of the SERP. This has been used by some SEO agencies to manipulate keyword suggestions, so let’s see how Baidu will update its algorithm to curb any possible blackhat SEO techniques.Tags: Baidu, Baidu Relevant Search, China, Reputation Management, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4007,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/baidu-relevant-search/','Baidu Relevant Search - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Baidu Relevant Search What is Baidu Relevant Search?

When some companies now re-do their website, they tend to upgrade to HTML5. HTML5 is becoming more and more popular, as the programmers feel that the old W3C HTML standard does not cater to their real world development needs. In HTML5, there are a lot of new attributes and tags which can be used for SEO as well. I will use couple of blog posts to share The Egg’s SEO standards in HTML5.1. Javascript must be placed in external files, the code must be placed before </head> or </body>.2. CSS must be placed in external files, and the code must be placed before </head> as well as before the JavaScript code.3. Do not use these elements: applet、basefont、center、dir、font、isindex、menu、s、strike、u、xmp.4. Follow xhtml 1.0 standard：1) Use lower case for tag name in all elements.2) There must be a value assigned for tag property, for example:<input checked=”checked”><input readonly=”readonly”><input disabled=”disabled”><option selected=”selected”>3) All the elements should be closed (special attention to p and li)；5. Elements such as meta, link, br, img, input should be closed with a slash at the end (e.g. <br />).All the form elements (such as input、select、textarea, except for button) must define name property.6. Page structure should not rely on Javescript. With Javascript forbidden, the page still be can be displayed normally, for example, user still can see the second level navigations.7. Must claim the DOCTYPE at the top of the page. Page must have html, head and body element. Title element must be included in <head> element. Below is a sample structure of standard HTML5 page<!dotype html><html lang=”zh-ch”><head><meta charset=”utf-8”><title>Page Title</title><link rel=”stylesheet” href=””><script src=””></script></head><body></body></html>In the next article, we will share more practices in HTML5.Tags: HTML5, International, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Global','article'),(4011,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-internet-image-search-era-comes/','China Internet Image Search Era Comes','','An analysis of the image search functions of the three main search engines in China being Baidu, Google, and Sogou and tests of their accuracy in producing results...','As we know Tineye.com is a famous image search engine. In China, Baidu launched its image search image function (http://stu.baidu.com) late last year. In the middle of 2011, Google released its search by image feature (http://www.google.com.hk/imghp). Soon after on Aug 15, 2011 Sogou (http://pic.sogou.com/)also launched this function.The search views and functions of the three search engines are highly similar. You can upload an image or copy and paste an image URL. What can we obtain when we search by images? Well, you can find relevant information such as the name, news, etc. of an unfamiliar star or person; you can find the shooting information of a picture; you can find the picture’s reference site; and when you have a picture on hand, you can find a larger size of the image, or one with no watermark, or even ps artwork before processing.As Baidu, Google and Sogou have all launched their image search image functions in China, it is interesting to know the different results which currently come from the three search engines. Below is a comparison chart from Sogou, which Sogou claims reveals the search results from the three search engines for image searches. This Sogou chart is divided into five parts: Perfect match images; content associated with an image; appearance of a similar image; image content identification; convenient drag and drop images. From the chart, we learn that Baidu’s search by image feature is not better than Google’s and Sogou’s.I conducted two tests to compare the three search engines. For the first test I put an Optimus Prime image into each. The search results are similar. My original image can be found as well as a larger one along with other reference information. For my second test I uploaded a lace wedding shoe. The results this time are different.After searching for the shoe on Google, Google will automatically suggest a probable keyword for the image. The suggested keyword “lace wedding shoes” is quite similar to my own guess keyword “white rose shoes”. Google shows 7 pages for the image and I am glad to see all 70 sites are about these kind of shoes.Sogou, however, shows the image size and only one relevant result. So it seems at the moment Sogou is not as strong as they have indicated in the above chart which they produced, however as a small search engine the function is acceptable. Of course, it needs to improve its accuracy and indexed results.The Baidu search result is disappointing. It provides no result but a sentence: “sorry, no results found matching the picture. Thank you for using Baidu STU, we will continue to enhance the effect.” The search by image function of Baidu STU is still a test version, even though it launched 10 months ago.So is the China Internet Image Search Era coming?From my perspective, I think the image search function is important. It is important for various reasons such as when shopping online for the same thing, if we can find a cheaper price by doing an image search then that would be great. As I know, Taobao is now testing its search by image function called “Imagine” (http://imagine.taobao.com/). Taobao is the first C2C website to get into the search by image field. If the search by image technology becomes mature, the original works will greatly increase. For the SEO field, SEOer’s should not just pay attention to the image tags, but also focus on the image design because an attractive image may bring you more traffic!Tags: Baidu, China, Image Search, Onsite Optimization, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4013,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/image-search/','Image Search - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' China Internet Image Search Era Comes As we know Tineye.com is a famous image search engine.

Baidu Xinzhi fits in well with Baidu’s existing product line which includes Baidu Zhidao and Baidu Baike. At present, Xinzhi is under initial testing and needs an invitation code to sign up and login. Applying for Baidu’s invitation code requires the user to enter a real name, email address, job title and self-introduction. It is believed that a respectable job title enables the Baidu invitation code to be applied for more easily.Baidu Xinzhi is just like a mixture of a Q&A platform and a microblog. Following, follower, interesting question, interesting topic and message reminding functions can be found in your personal centre. Meanwhile, on the right side of the page, Xinzhi recommends someone, some questions and some topics you may have an interest in. Besides typing some words in the search box, you can also go to Xinzhi Square to find the hottest questions and answers.An interesting function of XinzhiXinzhi has a number of interesting functions. For example, for any question, you can go through all the answers; find those you agree and disagree with, and then vote on the answers. And the answers can be ranked by modified time or “agree” vote quantity. Baidu Xinzhi believes answers with most votes are the best answer. This is quite a good functionality.From Baidu Zhidao to Baidu Jingyan, and now that Baidu has launched Xinzhi, we can observe that Baidu is chasing after valuable knowledge sharing. The most important part of this SNS knowledge community is keeping the value of people’s interactions.Xinzhi questions and answers cover various topics so how Baidu can maintain the high quality of each question is the critical point. For now, there is not a tool that can identify the best question. If it fails, Xinzhi is likely to become another Zhidao. However, as huge traffic is Baidu’s footstone; if Baidu promotes Xinzhi, Xinzhi is likely to become the biggest SNS questions and answers community in China.Tags: Baidu, Baidu Xinzhi, China, Microblogs, Social MediaCategory: SEO, SEO China, Social, Social Media China','article'),(4016,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/baidu-xinzhi/','Baidu Xinzhi - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Baidu new product – Xinzhi Baidu Xinzhi is a search-based social network platform located in China and which launched on June 8, 2011.

As also mentioned in my last post, Sogou has overtaken SOSO to become the third largest search engine in China, after Baidu and Google. As reported by China Market Research Firm iResearch, search queries to China search engines in Q2 amounted to 73 Billion. Sogou had 2.93 billion search queries in Q2.This is a significant 89% increase when compared to the search queries it received in the same period last year. Comparing year on year, the increase was 192.9% so the influence of Sogou is definitely growing and it looks like Sogou pinyin and the Sogou internet browser are becoming more popular with Chinese internet users.Both of these two tools have brought a lot of search traffic to Sogou. Soso was the third biggest search engine in China in Q1 but has now dropped to 4th position in Q2 demonstrating Sogou’s better functionality and increasing popularity over it.Sogou’s results page layout is interesting. In displaying its PPC ads, Sogou is like a combination of Baidu and Google. When you search any keyword, you can see up to ten ads above the organic results just like in Baidu. However, users can click a button to fold up the PPC ads and then the interface looks more like Google.If Sogou continues to increase in popularity, the China search engine market will become even more interesting than it already is and I believe the main worry is for Google which continues to lose market share since Google CN moved to HK. As SEOers, if Sogou traffic is increasing then we definitely need to take SEO for Sogou into consideration for generating more traffic. And in doing so one good first step as I mentioned in my last post is to set up Google Analytics so it can record organic traffic from Sogou which it will only do after certain tweaks are made to the tracking codes on your site. For more on how to do this please see my colleague Vennie’s post on this topic.Tags: Baidu, China, Google, Google China, Market Research, Search Engine Market Share, SEO, Sogou, SosoCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4019,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/diandian-light-blogging-offsite-link-building-in-china/','Diandian Light blogging offsite link building in China','','More details of the Diandian Light Blogging Platform in China and its usefullness for building offsite links as well as acting as a useful branding channel in China','Since Diandian launched its light blogging platform in April, its user groups are growing rapidly. Website owners are using the platform to build offsite links on Diandian. Today I was surfing on Diandian and I found an interesting offsite link building example.The example site (http://www.omkong.com) was launched on 21st, July which is concentrating on Western Fashion clothing styles. Omkong.com and itsfan.com are owned by the same company. Thus omkong.com and itsfan.com are on Diandian light blogging together. By using this light blogging platform, the administrator is maintaining updated content of images and links every day. They usually post a charming fashion girl image then with a link below. The common format for this kind of link building is shown below:Source: http://zheshifan.diandian.com/When checking omkong.com’s offsite links on Yahoo explorer, there are no less than 1000 in-bound links. When analyzing these 1000 links, 86% of them come from different forums. Omkong.com built 77 links on Diandian and of these 25 so far have now been indexed. As I mentioned above, omkong.com only went online on July 21st, which is only 4 weeks from today, so its link building efforts so far have been impressive. Below is the breakdown of Omkong.com’s offsite linking profile.There are 5 functions on Diandian light blogging which we can use to share, they are: text, images, music, links, and videos. At this point, the links we add are all direct links which is different from Sina-microblogging which will automatically revise URLs. You are free to place anchor text in the links you build in the content. It is also possible to distribute anchor text and links is in the descriptions of each function.SummaryOmkong.com is lucky because of the 77 offsite links it has built in a month, already 25 are indexed by Yahoo Site explorer, which is a relatively short period of time.Search engines are indexing Diandian pages now. Even though Diandian is not a site with high authority at this moment, I believe it soon will be.Diandian is an innovation for social media in China whose core is peoples interests in sharing, but also provides an effective means of creating relevant links for your company’s website. In short, Diandian and other light blogging platforms in China would appear to provide an effective link building method and branding platform which should be considered by anyone involved in digital marketing or doing SEO in China.Tags: Blogging, China, DianDian, Light Blogging, Link Building, Microblogs, SEO, Social MediaCategory: SEO, SEO China, Social, Social Media China','article'),(4021,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/diandian/','DianDian - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Diandian Light blogging offsite link building in China Since Diandian launched its light blogging platform in April, its user groups are growing rapidly.

This time the topic was ‘search engines’ and the list below shows us an interesting overview of the most visited search engines in Japan.The pie charts below will illustrate my point a little bit clearer.These numbers are actually in line with the latest available official numbers on the Japanese search engine market share from 2009, which show a share of around 55% for Yahoo! Japan and 30% for Google.However, these numbers are already three years old and looking at this table with the fresh data, we can see a trend which shows that the relative market share of the Google search properties (google.co.jp and google.com together) is bigger now compared to the numbers three years ago, under the assumption that other competitors have the exact same share as before.The pie charts below will illustrate my point a little bit clearer.Again, these pie charts do NOT represent the accurate market share distribution of the Japanese search engine market, but rather tries to show a trend of the relative popularity between the two biggest players in the Japanese search engine market.I hope that official numbers/studies on the market share are coming soon and will show whether or not I am right with my interpretation, but until then we have to work with the available data we have out there. After all, I think that Donnamedia’s data gives us an interesting insight into the latest development of the search engine market share in Japan in 2012.What do you think about this latest development?

On August 16, Qihoo 360, well known in China for its anti-virus software, directory and browser, entered the Chinese search engine space. The rapid market share growth of this search engine has drawn big attention for the past few weeks. It was reported that Qihoo 360 has overtaken Sogou and become the second largest search engine in China in terms of the new market share.According to Experian Hitwise China, in the week after its launching, Qihoo 360 has already jumped to an average 10% market share. Most of the traffic is coming from its browser.Soon enough, news about Qihoo 360 rivaling Baidu were spread out everywhere. On the night of 28 August, Baidu made a series of changes to prevent Qihoo 360 from taking advantage of its content like Baidu Zhidao, Baidu Baike, and other properties, and redirect any traffic from Qihoo 360 to their own homepage. Qihoo 360 then made moves to show the cached pages of any Baidu page on their result pages. On 1 September 2012, Baidu encrypted its result page URLs. At the time of writing, Baidu redirects the result from Qihoo 360 to its home page.Qihoo 360 does not have paid search yet, but it’s very likely they are going to show Google’s paid search and get some revenue from Google, as it’s probably too early for Qihoo 360 to develop its own paid search system.As SEOers, we have not taken any specific action and we are just keeping an eye on it. Plus CNNIC reported that Qihoo 360 has already lost about 47% of search users as the graph below shows on 2 September 2012 compared to 21 August 2012.However, we do recommend having web analytics to recognise Qihoo360 as a search engine. If you use Google Analytics, you can try inserting _gaq.push([\'_addOrganic\', \'so.360.cn\', \'q\']); into your GA code register it as a search engine. Then you will see the Qihoo 360 traffic in the search engine reports instead of the referral reports.Tags: Baidu, China SEO, qihooCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4035,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/chinas-search-engine-war-continues/attachment/3bwar-2/','Qihoo 360 Search on different browsers','','','Category: ','article'),(4036,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/Cresty%20Li/','Cresty Li - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Increasing Mobile Phone Usage Makes Voice Search Imperative With the decline in the cost of smart phones, it’s not an exaggeration to say that almost everyone owns one.

However, Japanese user subscriptions to Facebook have continued to rise – until now.According to statistics from Socialbakers and Cereja Technologies it appears that the number of Japanese Facebook users is diminishing rapidly.After user numbers peaked at 17 million in December 2012, recent reports have demonstrated that the figure has decreased to 13.8 million this month.Analysis from different sites suggest that Japanese Facebook users are growing tired of what has been dubbed the “mememe” culture of users’ Facebook timelines; this is a term coined by the mass media to accurately describe modern youth culture and their obsession with social media sharing. This is an indulgence which is often frowned upon in Japan.Another issue widely criticized by Japanese Facebook users is the social network’s policy of using real names. The policy contrasts with other SNS in Japan which allow the use of pseudonyms and nicknames.Mixi have assigned a new CEO, Yusuke Asakura, to try to capitalise on Facebook’s outflow of users in Japan by restoring the struggling social network to its former glory.The Japanese SNS’s power shuffle was followed by an announcement that the network is investing in two start-up businesses to diversify its assets.Although it remains to be seen whether Mixi’s efforts will succeed in attracting Japanese social media users away from Facebook, there is no doubt that their timing has been impeccable, and might well see the platform ascend once again to become Japan’s leading social media site.

Japan, we would like to present another social media integration of a major search engine in East Asia. This time, your Korea SEO work might get a little more interesting.On February 21, Naver announced the implementation of social sharing right from within the SERP, similar to Google’s sharing option with G+ when you are logged in. This is how Google’s social sharing in its SERP looks like at the moment:However, shareable search results and sharing platforms offered on the Naver SERP are completely different and less self-centered than the one’s by big G, as Naver offers more than only its own social media properties. Additionally, you don’t need to be logged in and it is also available on the mobile SERPs to an even greater extent than on the desktop version (see summary table below).The new sharing feature was rolled out for the desktop and mobile SERPS at the same time and depending on which version you use, the shareable categories and sharing options are different. You can see how the sharing functions are presented for desktop and mobile version on the screenshots below:Regarding the differences for the two versions, I came up with following table to illustrate what kind of search results are shareable and to which platforms those results can be shared to.Naver announced that this feature is most likely to be expanded, so chances are high that we are going to see some changes or additions for the shareable search results or the sharing platforms in the table above. We need to keep a close eye on further developments and announcements. In general, however, it would be interesting to know how many people are actually using this kind of SERP social sharing, for both Google and Naver.What are your thoughts on this new function?

Advertisers can select from three ad placement options: 搜索推广 (unofficial translation: “Search Promotion”), 品牌直达 (unofficial translation: Brand Express), and 猜你喜欢 (unofficial translation: “Guess-U-Like”). Search Promotion is similar to Google AdWords with maximum 3 placements on the top of search results and maximum 8 on the side. Brand Express is similar to Baidu’s Brand Zone.

The post goes on to explain that ICANN has approved a whole new range of domain endings in English, Chinese, Korean and Japanese to name a few.The new domain endings have led to multiple companies applying for the rights to administer them. Tencent and Sina have both applied for the .weibo extension in both Chinese and English languages, meaning that there’s a new arena for them to compete in if they don’t want to share the responsibility.ICANN’s list of applications also shows that Baidu has applied for .baidu, a step to protect its own brand name, whilst its search engine competitor Qihoo has opted to bid for phonetic translations of .cloud and .security; neither has applied for actual Chinese character extensions.The Wall Street Journal post also theorises that China’s Internet users may already be used to typing in domain endings in English. Considering that a large portion of users will use the pinyin method to input Chinese languages, it is a fair point and should have some weight.ICANN’s president Fady Chehadé firmly believes that the extensions will promote the Internet’s universality, in addition to witnessing a new wave of website registrations, saying, “In China the numbers will be staggering once we release the all Chinese character domain names.”It is fantastic news that the Internet will become more accessible to a wider number of people. For us, we’re obviously looking to see if these extra language domains will have any impact on search engine performance.

One week later, Naver itself wrote an official post on its main blog about the implementation of the new algorithm.The official implementation started on December 4, and the algorithm especially aims at two main points: better text analysis and inclusion of the credibility of the source. Over the years, Naver analyzed the common points of satisfying and unsatisfying blog posts and implemented the results in the logic behind ‘Libra’. Due to these results it is now possible to identify high quality blog posts and credible blogs and give them preference in the rankings.At this time, the new algorithm will not be applied for all search results. Rather, keywords which are prone to manipulated search results, and thus are known as having very unsatisfying results for the users (e.g. ‘good restaurants in…’), are going to be prioritized. Around 1.5%-2% of all keywords are going to be affected at the first stage of implementation, according to Naver.Moreover, the biggest Korean search engine released another official post with a guideline on how to become a credible blog and how to write high quality, hence well ranking, blog posts. The guidelines also gives some hints on which factors would negatively influence the ranking of a blog post.However, Naver also points out that it cannot give away all information on the ranking factors, as this would only induce manipulation, which is one of the things Naver wants to wipe out with the new algorithm in the first place.My next post will go through some of the finer details of the algorithm changes, particularly what factors Naver considers as good or bad. Hopefully, it will prove useful for your search activity in Korea and help explain some of the perceived myths.Tags: Naver, Naver BlogCategory: SEO, SEO Korea','article');

Naturally, this will have an impact on the Internet, but to what extent has it changed the status quo?Compared to a desktop computer, mobile phones have the advantage of being conveniently compact and portable. However, this is only one side of the story. In order to allow users to make greater use of mobile phones, more effort is needed, such as functional convenience. How to make the phone easier to use?Mobile phone functions have gradually brought the handset closer to the computer. And the emergence of smart phones makes mobile phones look more like a microcomputer. As prices continue to tumble, users of smart phones have grown exponentially.Invariably, this has led to more people using mobile phones to surf the Internet. Phone applications, such as those for mobile banking and mobile search, have emerged. In order to compete for a larger share of the growing mobile phone market, search engines should pay more attention to the convenience of mobile search.For the phone itself, the basic function is the call. Combining the call function with other functions, voice control is much more convenient than typing a query into the phone. Imagine completing the query, search, sending messages and more via a variety of software controlled by voice. This should be the most convenient method for mobile phone users to do some searches.Obviously, all search engines are considering how to increase their own market share of. In order to grow, voice search function is imperative. Siri’s appearance has acted like a guiding light to attract everyone’s attention, and has also raised awareness of the need for the development of voice applications. Currently, Sogou has also developed a voice assistant. Baidu launched voice plan of its own too. Of course, Google won’t miss this good opportunity - Google is also developing its own voice applications.Tags: China Mobile Market, Mobile SearchCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4104,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/mobile-search/','Mobile Search - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Increasing Mobile Phone Usage Makes Voice Search Imperative With the decline in the cost of smart phones, it’s not an exaggeration to say that almost everyone owns one.

This keyword tool is Naver’s equivalent to Google trends, and offers unique insights in its database.Naver trend might be particularly interesting for analysing seasonal or event-based traffic performances of certain keywords in the past. Needless to say that the insights could be of great value for Korean SEO and PPC campaigns in particular and marketing campaigns in general. Just as with Google trends, different options and features are offered in Naver’s keyword trends tool. It is possible to compare up to five keywords and blend in news headlines in order to get a better understanding of the traffic peaks.The first options one can choose from are the two categories ‘web searches’ and ‘mobile searches’. Combined results of both sources are not provided at this stage. Regarding the date range, one month, three months, one year, the whole record, or a custom range can be chosen and the records go all the way back to January 2007. Results can be downloaded as .csv files.Similar to Google trends, results are only in relative numbers, whereas ‘100’ illustrates the highest traffic point of the researched keyword within the chosen time period. All other results are measured relatively to that peak traffic point.Naver Trend has just been released and is still in Beta phase. It might therefore still have some points to improve, but Naver claims that it is going to further develop the tool and provide better results in future. From an SEO point of view, this is a great tool to get some insights in the very complicated Korean search landscape. Let’s wait and see and hope that Naver will release further tools to help us understanding the market better.What do you think about this new tool? Do you have any experience with similar tools for the Korean market?

On August 16, Qihoo 360, well known in China for its anti-virus software, directory and browser, entered the Chinese search engine space. The rapid market share growth of this search engine has drawn big attention for the past few weeks. It was reported that Qihoo 360 has overtaken Sogou and become the second largest search engine in China in terms of the new market share.According to Experian Hitwise China, in the week after its launching, Qihoo 360 has already jumped to an average 10% market share. Most of the traffic is coming from its browser.Soon enough, news about Qihoo 360 rivaling Baidu were spread out everywhere. On the night of 28 August, Baidu made a series of changes to prevent Qihoo 360 from taking advantage of its content like Baidu Zhidao, Baidu Baike, and other properties, and redirect any traffic from Qihoo 360 to their own homepage. Qihoo 360 then made moves to show the cached pages of any Baidu page on their result pages. On 1 September 2012, Baidu encrypted its result page URLs. At the time of writing, Baidu redirects the result from Qihoo 360 to its home page.Qihoo 360 does not have paid search yet, but it’s very likely they are going to show Google’s paid search and get some revenue from Google, as it’s probably too early for Qihoo 360 to develop its own paid search system.As SEOers, we have not taken any specific action and we are just keeping an eye on it. Plus CNNIC reported that Qihoo 360 has already lost about 47% of search users as the graph below shows on 2 September 2012 compared to 21 August 2012.However, we do recommend having web analytics to recognise Qihoo360 as a search engine. If you use Google Analytics, you can try inserting _gaq.push([\'_addOrganic\', \'so.360.cn\', \'q\']); into your GA code register it as a search engine. Then you will see the Qihoo 360 traffic in the search engine reports instead of the referral reports.Tags: Baidu, China SEO, qihooCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4110,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-search-market-share-battle-is-the-browser-an-essential-weapon/','China Search Market Share Battle – is the Browser an Essential Weapon?','','At present, the major search engines in China are Baidu, Google CN, Soso, and Sogou. Baidu has the highest market share which is about 63% greater than its','At present, the major search engines in China are Baidu, Google CN, Soso, and Sogou. Baidu has the highest market share which is about 63% greater than its closest competitor, Google CN.For the past 2 years Baidu consistently captured more than 70% of the market and continues to grow. In contrast, ever since Google announced its withdrawal from China in 2010, its market share continued to drop. Soso and Sogou have a very small market share but we can see they have had steady growth. Sogou’s market share has momentum and grown to 2.9% while Soso’s grew at a slower pace to 1.5%.From the point of view of search market share, no competitor can seem to move Baidu from its solid top position. Can competitors enhance their influence on the market through other means? One method might be to develop and enhance their own browsers.Google has their Chrome browser and in the hope to gain a foothold in this battle Sogou has developed Sogou Browser. Tencent’s Soso has been paired with the company’s own Tencent Traveler (TT) browser. Let’s have a brief look at the search tools offered by these three browsers:Chrome doesn’t have a search box but visitors can enter a search query directly in the address bar then initiate a Google search.Sogou Brower has a search box in the upper right corner. Its default search engine is Sogou but allows users to change to Baidu, Google or even add a new search engine. Although this provides more options to the user, it might represent a lack of confidence in their own search engine’s capabilities.TT also has a search box in the upper right but unsurprisingly only allows the use of Soso’s search engine.Baidu does have its own browser but it was the last to release among these 4 browsers. Users can also set Google as the default search engine. It means in Baidu’s opinion Google is the only one who has enough power to compete with them on market share.Being the dominant search engine in China and with profits much higher than other competitors, it implies Baidu hadn’t previously had the urgency to promote its browser. In contrast, Baidu’s competitors all invested in developing their own browsers much earlier in an attempt to gain market share.In terms of browser market share, at present IE still dominates. IE6 holds 25.49%, followed by Qihoo 360 at 20.76% then IE7 and IE8. Although Sogou Browser and TT still have smaller market shares, their efforts in trying to grow are evident. Sogou has taken great efforts in increasing the availability of browser, but in the search engine field, they still need to strengthen further. As for TT, Tencent already has a large number of loyal users and if it continues to invest in improving TT and Soso, they have the potential to further increase their market share.Recently Qihoo 360 publish its own search engine – 360 search engine.According to all points mentioned, no competitor seems capable of challenging Baidu’s dominant position in the short term. Even though Google has left the China market, its previous influence remains and it should not be underestimated. With the newer local search engines, Sogou and Soso, they should continue to invest in improving their service to gain more users. On the other hand, now Qihoo 360 has its own search engine and its market share growing rapidly, and it was recently involved in a collision with Baidu – more on that in an upcoming postAre browsers the key to increasing search market share?

The updates result in significant impact on both indexation and rankings of thousands of websites.','Baidu has been implementing big algorithm updates since April, and the updates have had a significant impact on both indexation and rankings of thousands of websites. It seems that the updates are ongoing and it has been widely reported that two major updates happened in the past month, one on June 22, 2012 and the other on June 28, 2012. These updates have also been acknowledged by Baidu Engineer “Lee” from Baidu’s anti-spam team. This is quite a new development for Baidu SEO as previously Baidu generally did not acknowledge when changes had been made and it was left to the blogosphere to piece together what had happened.So what’s the update about? According to Lee, the June 21, 2012 update implemented anti-spam measures targeting poor quality websites. Poor quality websites have long time appeared in Baidu search results and of course Baidu is concerned this will lead to a poor user experience for searchers. Lee defined poor quality websites as those that have very poor content and in particular “spun” content. The sole purpose of these websites is for manipulating the search results, a common practice in Baidu SEO.After this June 22nd update, many webmasters complain that their sites lost significant rankings or disappeared altogether. Most of those complaining were SME company websites that do not update their content frequently. Lee did acknowledge that generally they can accurately identify and remove websites with poor content but “collateral damage” is hard to avoid. If this happens to your website, you could report it through http://tousu.baidu.com/webmaster/suggest. Lee also said this is the start of a series of action; however, Baidu will in future make announcements on big updates through the recently launched Baidu Webmaster Tools. If you don’t have Baidu Webmaster Tools set up, now might be a good time.This is really a wake-up call to all webmasters and especially those who attempt to create dozens of websites in order to manipulate the search results.

Before this, Baidu had already been working with other weibo’s in China such as Tencent Weibo, Sohu Weibo, Netease Weibo, while Sina didn’t actually didn’t allow Baidu to crawl its site. This is a milestone for Chinese social and search.Below is an example search result when I search the keyword “英语培训”(translation: English Training). It shows the 3 latest posts from Sina Weibo. Users cannot click the weibo text to go to Sina Weibo, but they can go to the Sina Weibo by clicking the name of Weibo and then clicking “comment”.As a SEOer, we have to spend more effort now to get keywords ranked in the first page results. Today, a top 10 result does not mean a first page result anymore. When we do the keyword research, we might want to know what keywords trigger Sina Weibo results as well. We might also be able to take advantage of the integration of Sina Weibo and Baidu to help on creating extra exposure or brand management.I also did an interesting test myself. I posted a weibo that includes the keyword “英语培训”, and it got listed in the Baidu search result 1 minute after I posted it (shown in the screenshot below). It also pushed out the oldest post that was in the result.For now, the logic is still simple. It just shows the latest relevant weibo post.

The name of the album, however, may well change punctuation searches in search engines.“To my first reaction, the album name frustrates mp3 search engine so much.” said Wang xiaochuan, the CEO of Sogou. In fact, it can be imagined that most of the Eason Chan’s fans and mp3 enthusiasts will directly type “?” to search for the album in the search bar rather than search ing through detailed information.So far, Soso, Bing and Youdao will not return any result for “?”. On the contrary, when you search “?” in Baidu, Sogou (regardless of system default Home or mp3 search), the search results will display related information of Eason Chan’s album.The only result of “?” in Baidu Web Search is for Eason Chan’s new album3 related results to the “?” for Eason Chan’s new album in Sogou web searchThis is the influence of the brand character (instant hot events). Though according to common sense, people who search for “?” or other punctuations for other reasons may be much more than the ones who search specifically for Eason Chan’s “?” album. However, as these users are too scattered, search engines will not attach importance to such searches and may ignore them due to search rules.The only result of “。”(full stop) in Baidu Web Search is Baidu BaikeBut for Eason Chan’s new album, it’s important to realize that he has a lot of fans in the Asia-Pacific. If there are no results in other search engines while Baidu and Sohu can provide them – one aspect wanes, the other waxes – it will create a great deal of comparative advantage and cause a positive brand impact. What’s more, more people may be attracted to choose them as their own priority search engine.This case seems to be an isolated incident. In fact, it is very typical. The current development of the search engines is heavily influenced by hot social events and fashion trends. Search engines are increasingly concerned about the star (brand), the development of hot events, especially for an instant impact with a huge hot figure. Search engines should become more and more flexible and even change their rules of the game, adjusting the overall configuration of their systems and upgrading their technology.Tags: Baidu, China, SEO, SogouCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4131,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/roy-chen/','Roy Chen - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Artist changed punctuation search on Baidu and Sogou People who are familiar with search engines know that the keywords to be used for search engines can be a mixture of Chinese, English, and numbers, and can also be one or more words, phrases, short words and sentences, but cannot be mere punctuations.

Weibo is not merely an entertainment platform as Weibo is also widely used as a communication channel between government and people and helps to hold public-service activities. But even so, there seems to be a worry about Weibo facing a plateau – as users enthusiasm seems to be falling off a bit.The diagrams below from iResearch show Sina and Tencent Weibo user scales in the first 10 months of 2011. In August 2011, Weibo user coverage achieved the peak and on September the user scale decreased (marked red circle). The user scale continued to decrease in October 2011 and has downward trend.The following two charts are the screen shots of the Alexa open data platform which analyzes Sina Weibo. The left chart shows the daily traffic rank trend of weibo.com. We notice that the daily traffic rank has remained steady in the third quarter of 2011 (marked red oblate). The chart on the right provides estimated daily time on site for weibo.com. Similarly, from around August 2011, the time on site has declined (marked red arrow).In the iResearch chart we are talking about Tencent and Sina Weibo user numbers and in the Alexa charts the discussion is about Sina Weibo. It happens that the number of China (Sina + Tencent) Weibo users and Sina Weibo users’ trend and the user average daily time on site trend is similar. So can we question whether the Sina Weibo users as well as China Weibo users are showing less and less enthusiasm? From my perspective, Weibo was indeed a fresh online social experience, but over a period of time, my interest was reduced. Sina Weibo made version updates last year but I don’t think they were very useful to enlarge the user base. Below are some of my personal views:At first, from a philosophy angle, everything develops in zigzags and by roundabout ways, and so does Weibo. Sina Weibo started operations in 2009, and if any early stage users are beginning to reduce their interest this can be considered a normal phenomenon. One key point affecting this is that there have not been consistently new features being added over time and so it has become a little boring to use Weibo from my point of view.Second, Sina Weibo made good use of the celebrity effect which played an important role in its growth. But the celebrity effect cannot be effective in maintaining users’ interest of Weibo. When the distance of users to the celebrity becomes zero, the mystery also becomes zero, then finally the attraction reduces.Third, Microblogging quality has decreased. Old Microbloggings are reposted again and again which reduces the interest for users. Weibo is a commercial tool for many companies. For an Overseas Travel Agency microblogging example, microblogs are used with some text and a beautiful destination image. This is a very boring use of microblogs by OTA’s.Last but not least, there exist a lot of mendacious users that have caused a bad experience for normal users. Almost 100% of the mendacious users are interest-leading, some of them are controlled by machines, and are often used to annoy the normal users.In summary, Sina Weibo is likely facing a plateau in usage at this stage. To find the right profit model is really an urgent task for Sina Weibo.Tags: Blogging, China, Market Research, Microblogs, Sina Weibo, Social MediaCategory: Social, Social Media China','article'),(4135,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/do-you-have-baidu-share-code-on-your-web-pages/','Do you have Baidu Share code on your web pages','','An explanation of how Baidu Share works and how you can get the code to implement it on your site','This week, Baidu started including “Baidu Share” data in its search results.It looks similar to Google +1, but it does not work exactly like Google +1.

As Baidu is the most widely used search engine in China, we may get a lot of benefit from the authoritative answers of Baidu for SEO questions when we need to do optimization for websites.Here are several common difficult SEO problems collected from the Baidu webmaster club which have been answered by the Baidu search engineer.1. What factors will lead to only the homepage of the website being indexed when queried with the site command?Two cases:A. New site. The specific contents are not crawled and indexed promptly.B. Old site. It was severely punished for various reasons, which is also known as “plucking” by webmasters.2. Will the numbers of internal links removed will cause a sudden drop in page weight to the main domain?Take the examples of Baidu, Sina and other major sites. Each page also has links direct to the homepage of the website, and they are not being “killed off”. That means it will not have any negative impact. As a matter of fact, the internal links are used for communicating with pages. For the search engine, they are only used for discovering new links and determining a page’s position in the entire site. (Although the internal links will not bring about a decrease in Baidu page weight, it doesn’t mean we can make excessive use of them. After all, we should comply with the normal habits and the natural expression)3. Does Baidu now fully support nofollow?Baidu now supports the nofollow tag. We will ignore the impact of links with nofollow tag such that the page weight of the links will not be counted while the nofollow tag is in force. (Adding nofollow to comments links is controversial. As Baidu completely negates the effect of nofollow, it can be understood that the links with nofollow still have a little effect. Of course, the quality will not be as good as normal links with anchor text, yet changes in quantity will lead to changes in quality.)4. Will the anchor text links used with the same color as the background be treated as hidden links?This is not a constructive problem because the answer is so obvious. (We should pay more attention to this when doing link building.)5. Will websites be punished because of the same server or the same IP?Generally speaking, it will not happen to a mature search engine. (In fact, it is difficult to ensure websites with same IPs will be operating normally over a long period, as it is inevitable that some issues may appear in some sites. If websites will be punished by search engines just due to another website with the same IP, we cannot benefit from sharing IPs, which is not equitable.)6. Will comments for the content will be crawled and analysed by Baidu?The footnotes in html will be ignored when the spider is crawling the text. (Although the notes of the code will not be crawled, it can still result in the case of jumbled code, so add the notes as less as possible)7. Are the click through rates of the links included in Baidu’s algorithm?Search engines are likely to be trying to apply all the factors which may be conducive to improved sorting, and Baidu is no exception. (Click-through rates can also reflect the user experience, although high click through rates doesn’t mean high ranking.)8. Does Baidu have any suggestions for how many outbound links would be best for a page?In ordinary circumstances, the number of links will affect the page weight of the webpage. The less outbound links the higher the page weight, and vice versa.9. Why is the title in the search results from Baidu sometimes inconsistent with the actual title of the webpage?It’s a complex issue and requires specific analysis. It is probably mainly due to tag title extraction failures, and so the system had to take some text from other parts of the text as a title. Reasons for extraction failure would be web design (for example, all are with flash or ajax), or banned by robots file (although the crawler does not capture some important pages, it will retain the URL itself). Finally, sometimes an abnormal system can also cause a similar phenomenon.10. Which robots meta tag does Baidu support?Baidu supports the nofollow and noarchive meta tags. We will regularly update the information related to robots in http://www.baidu.com/search/robots.html. It is recommended to pay close attention to it. (According to Baidu Search Help Center, Baidu doesn’t support noindex yet.)The problems above are very common for SEO problems. Although the answers by the Baidu search engineer are not very detailed and specific. After all, it is impossible for the search engine department to make the basic principles open to the public, otherwise the search engine will be in chaos. In short we should do website optimization and construction from a user’s perspective, while treating the search engines as ordinary visitors, and make the content and links more natural and reasonable.Tags: Baidu, China, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4140,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/social-media-china/china-business-related-social-networking-sites/','China Business-Related Social Networking Sites','','A description of the dynamic and rapidly growing China Business Social Networking space and the prospects for its future development.','LinkedIn is a business-related social networking site (BSNS) which was founded in 2002. In the world’s SNS, LinkedIn is the second largest social networking site outside of Facebook, and was successfully listed in the U.S. this year. As a BSNS, LinkedIn’s success confirms the great potential of the BSNS market and delivers confidence to Chinese BSNS investors. China BSNS development and current situationAs far back as 2004, Chinese entrepreneurs were getting into the BSNS area and they created Tianji.com; Jrq.cn; Wealink.com; Renhe.cn etc. during this period. But at that time, Chinese SNS was experiencing its early stage development and users were more partial to using entertainment SNS sites rather than BSNS sites. Inevitably, many of the early BSNS sites gradually began to close down. In recent years, a batch of new BSNS sites have been launched, such as Dajie.com, Ushi.com, Jingwei.com and Aceona.com.Among these, Dajie.com and Jrq.cn belong to the “recruitment SNS” model. Over years of development, China users’ expectations have become more diversified. Their expectations of SNS are no longer limited to entertainment but also to receive more helpful information. This is generating a great opportunity for BSNS. I think this is one important reason that investors are now returning to the China BSNS market. It is worth mentioning that in July this year, Baidu; Tencent and Sina Microblogging have also entered the online recruitment industry formally, with Baidu launching Baijob.com and Tencent and Sina Microblogging opening BSNS functions.Almost every BSNS site claims itself to be China’s largest BSNS site, but there is no data showing the evidence in support of this. In addition, more importantly, the business models among the BSNS sites are nearly the same: with revenue coming from recruitment, advertising and membership fees. Recruitment and advertising are the leading income generators of the sites. From the business models and service homogenization, we can see there is no company which has embarked on a unique path. The BSNS native mode yet is still being explored.Tianji.com adheres to the China BSNS routeWhen talking about China BSNS sites, we cannot ignore Tianji.com. Tianji.com was established in 2004. After 8 years of operation, Tianji.com now has almost 18 million registered users and is leading the industry. In March 2009, France’s largest BSNS Company, Viadeo, merged with Tianji.com, giving Tianji.com a competitive advantage over other China BSNS sites. Tianji.com has recently completed a new version update, and is getting ready to face expected increased competition.Some difficulties for China BSNSThere are some difficulties facing China BSNS sites. Firstly, in China, social relations mainly rely on strong relationships which are fundamentally different from western culture.Secondly, network security. BSNS requires more accurate personal information than entertainment SNS, and so China Internet users have safety concerns about Network security. This point limits the amount of information users are prepared to supply to BSNS Sites in China.Thirdly, China’s Internet as a whole is entertainment-oriented and is only just beginning to develop more business focus.Fourthly, China Internet usage is almost free. It’s very different to foreign countries.With these strong difficulties to face, although it is a great time to develop a China BSNS, the localization process is bound to be slow and tortuous.Tags: Aceona, Baidu, China, Dajie, Jingwei, Sina, Social Media, Tencent, Tianji, UshiCategory: Social, Social Media China','article'),(4142,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/aceona/','Aceona - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' China Business-Related Social Networking Sites LinkedIn is a business-related social networking site (BSNS) which was founded in 2002.

The VP for Interactive Marketing with Ogilvy Public Relations, Rohit Bhargava, coined the term SMO on his blog post in 2006. The main spirit of SMO is connecting tightly with social media platforms in order to convert those users with your valuable content into customers or others who free ‘talk’ about what you are doing to others, then drive more target traffic to your website. When SMO came out, China’s SNS and microblogging were not as popular as now. In my personal view, it’s a good time to lay store by SMO. Let’s see the image of China’s social media landscape below:Source:http://www.simonbai.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/social_media_marketing.jpgContrast the outer rings with the simple inner ring of the world’s social media landscape. China’s social media landscape after several years of development is essentially similar to the world’s social media integration pattern. However, the social networking community formed by Chinese owns its cultural uniqueness. Currently China’s social media presents a flourishing state with no portal website dominating in every single part. But some portals perform prominently in some of the parts. For instance, Sina has a wide range of business but the most outstanding parts are Blogging, Microblogging and Q&A platform. In a separate breakdown of each area, the competition is always high; only one or two websites are the leader in the area. As a popular saying goes, “Huge market has tremendous opportunities.” Some companies focus on one area of social media optimization to promote sales. Now take an imperfect example of eLong Microblogging for reference.ELong’s performance was striking in the past year. In the third quarter, eLong retained profit is $ 9.4 million RMB compared to 1.2 million RMB last year, an increase of 683%. As an ordinary user, I also felt eLong visibility increased and recognition improved. This increasing profit of course ties in closely with its effective online marketing. SMO is a part of eLong online marketing strategy, and microblogging is the most intuitive SMO expression.From the above image, we can see the following information:* ELong fans: ELong has the largest scale fans, 105 million, on Sina microblogging compared to Ctrip’s 17 million and 17u’s 58 million. ELong Microblogging started early and developed rapidly; this leads eLong to attract early customers and establish reputation.* Series of sub-brand: Elong established its series of sub-brand microblogging by dividing the microblogs by different types of service: book hotel; eLong group buy; eLong tour guide and so on. I think it’s a smart idea to separate different services because it enables users to find what they need easily. 17u also set up some series brands, but I think it’s not better than eLong’s.* New activities development: Booking hotel through Microblog; check vacant rooms before group buy; check in hotel online and Last Minutes hotel promotion. Service diversification and humanization have made eLong hotel sales dramatically increase.* Microblogging forward number: eLong updates microblogging frequently and its usual mode is a short text with an attractive image. I don’t think the mode is special or good enough. But the forward number is generally hundreds.The above is a simple eLong microblogging analysis; even if the number of fans is not able to explain the marketing effect, we can clearly see eLong microblogging investment and the hard work. At least on Microblogging, eLong is doing better than the OTA giant Ctrip and its peers. Though there is no an accurate data provided so far, in my opinion, eLong’s profit enhancement this year has a significant contribution from microblogging.From the development of the Internet to present, search engines are not the unique entrance to Internet. Social media has become one of user Internet portals, and has a tendency to expand rapidly. When we develop SEO strategies, we should not only consider the feelings of the search engines but also should try to consider a whole SMO plan, to complement and benefit our SEO strategies.Tags: China, Elong, Microblogs, SEO, Sina, SMO, Social MediaCategory: SEO, SEO China, Social, Social Media China','article'),(4150,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/elong/','Elong - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' What about Adding SMO into SEO Strategy in China SMO stands for Social Media Optimization which is not a very new concept in digital marketing.

In Christmas 2007, when Apple introduced the new iPhone, you can turn it on and immediately be online. On that day the search volume of Google’s mobile search on the iPhone platform is more than sum total of all other mobile platforms.So far, mobile search and desktop search differences are not significant, but with the search engines constantly adjusting mobile search results to suit the user’s mobile environment and to counter potential competitors, desktop search and mobile search will become increasingly different in the future. For people who do Mobile SEO, optimizing for mobile search will involve more and more analytical work.Mobile search volume is growing along with the popularity of smart phones. A lot of people who engage in SEO say mobile search and desktop search are not very different. In the beginning, tests also confirmed this point, with the only difference being that the mobile version of the site is closer to the top. However, with the increasing scope of search keywords, we gradually are discovering the difference between the two.The difference between Baidu mobile search and desktop searchFrom this screenshot, we can see that for common used keywords, Baidu’s mobile search and desktop search are exactly the same, with the only difference being that the result page of Baidu Baike is shown as the mobile version in a mobile phone so that the wap version of web pages rank better.However, when we search for tourist attractions, the search results appear different. The top of page one of Baidu mobile search results is Tong Cheng Wang for advertising, with a big message box to provide the phone number, while the desktop version of Baidu search is based on IP location determine the corresponding geographical results.The difference between Baidu and Google Mobile SearchIn fact, Baidu and Google’s mobile search functions are similar. Baidu is more commercial and user-friendly, while Google still fulfills its pledge of “doing no evil”.Search behavior of mobile usersNow we understand why a lot of people say that mobile search and desktop search results are the same which is true, in fact, when limited to specific network keywords. To the mobile terminal, few users will search such kind of words: SEO, Website Optimization, etc and instead search to solve the problems around them; such as for snack bars, tourist attractions, bus routes and so on. As gesture search, voice search and other mobile search patterns increase in popularity, the basic mobile users do not need to go to Baidu’s home page to enter information for their searches.We can query the keyword search volume from mobile devices with Google AdWords toolThe difference between mobile search and desktop searchIn fact, mobile search ranking algorithms are confusing. It would be easier to show local search results with mobile search, but the search results cannot be filtered according to search and store brands, because the vast majority of people who use mobile search points of interest should be searching on local information. When compared with desktop search users, mobile search users may have a higher degree of concern of regarding search results, but due to the limited screen, very few users use the drop-down bar in mobile search results so that the ranking between the first and fourth hits may fall more than 90%.Filters are rarely used in mobile search results. Desktop searches will record your habits and show customized search results. For mobile search, Click-through rates and bounce rates determine keyword search result ranking factors. What’s more, for mobile search, the user’s “location” is the key, while it is not so important for desktop search. So if you want to optimize your mobile websites, doing regional optimization is essential, or even modifying the site location information should be considered.Tags: Baidu, China, Google, Google China, Mobile, Mobile Search, Mobile SEO, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4155,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/mobile/','Mobile - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Mobile Search – A Huge Market and Business Opportunity With the development of technology and smart phones, more and more people are using mobile to surf the Internet and also to conduct mobile shopping, so mobile SEO is becoming increasingly important.

Baidu uses different user-agents for different products as shown below.As a Baidu tech guy named Lee wrote on BaiduTieba, there are a number of instances which might cause baiduspider crawling failure, apart from Baidu’s own system problems. These instances are as follows:-1. Block UA/IPIf a webmaster gets Baidu’s UA or IP blocked, Baidu will not be able to index new pages. Any indexed pages will soon considered as dead links, and removed from the Baidu index database. This will affect the traffic from Baidu dramatically. Some over-frequent visits from Baiduspider can be caused by fake baidu spider user-agents. Webmasters can use reverse DNS lookup to check if the IP belongs to Baidu. The host name of Baidu spider normally ends with baidu.com or baidu.jp.2. Occasional block by server overloadOccasionally, frequent visits from Baiduspider cause server overload and servers will block the Baiduspider for that. In these circumstances, Baidu suggests to return a 503 code instead of a 404 code. Then Baiduspider can come back another time when the server has less pressure.3. Unstable server or change serverKeeping the server stable is very important. If the webmaster needs to change server, it’s recommended to keep the old one running for a while until Baiduspider starts crawling in just the new space.If the webmasters do not want Baidu to index certain pages or folders, they can use robot.txt to tell Baiduspider that.Tags: Baidu, Baidu Spider, China, Robots, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4159,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/robots/','Robots - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Common incidences that cause Baiduspider crawling failure As we all know, Baiduspider is the robot which Baidu uses to crawl websites on the Internet creating an indexed database, so that Baidu users can see relevant page search results.

Seemingly like a counterstrike, Baidu started indexing Microblog content from Tencent and Netease Microblogs, which are major competitors of Sina Weibo.However, according to my research, Baidu is still testing the feature, as when only searching for a very limited number of keywords, you may find Miroblog content in the Search Engine Result Pages (SERP’s).So how does the mechanism work?Actually Baidu has been integrating microblog content for about half a year, when in April it launched the Microblog Synchronization App – Box Microblog (框发微博). The application developed by the Baidu team indicates its importance to Baidu, as comparatively most Apps are developed by other companies and submitted to Baidu Open Platform to gain more exposure.Obviously the Box Microblog application doesn’t intend to get traffic from Baidu, but to gain its share in the trend of Microblogging, without stepping into the Microblog industry, which is very crowded and competitive. By utilizing Box Microblog to synchronize tweets to Tencent, Sohu and Netease Microblogs, and putting them in Open Platform, Baidu quietly finished the setup for the backend.The question is whether the Baidu SERP displays only the microblog content (tweets) posted from Box Microblog or whether Baidu is sending robots to crawl content from Tencent and Sohu Miroblogs. As the former looks to me the case (limited microblog content and Baidu with no interest in promoting others), marketers who want to get their microblogs displayed on Baidu SERP should consider using Box Microblog as the posting channel.Soso, part of Tencent, has been displaying Tencent Microblog content, though sometimes you can find Sohu Microblog content too. Compared to Baidu testing behavior, displaying Miroblog content has been a common thing to see on Soso.In conclusion, with China search engines now also displaying microblog content in their SERP’s, if you are not already doing so as part of your online marketing strategy, then you need to start a microblog to maximize the possibilities for your SEO in China.Tags: Baidu, Baidu Box Microblog, China, Microblogs, Netease, SEO, Social Search, Sohu, Soso, TencentCategory: SEO, SEO China, Social, Social Media China','article'),(4162,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/how-to-prevent-search-engines-from-indexing-is-a-question-worth-considering/','How to Prevent Search Engines from Indexing is a Question worth Considering','','An explanation from our China based SEO Expert Roy Chen on some good ways to prevent search engines from indexing your site or pages on it...','In general, trying to make search engines crawl and index more content is a real headache for SEO. If you are not listed and indexed, you can have no rankings. When a website has reached a certain scale, it’s not easy to have it fully indexed, especially for websites with hundreds of thousands of pages. No matter how well designed and optimized the site structure is, 100% indexation by the search engines is impossible. All you can do is try to maximize the collection rate.But sometimes preventing search engines from indexing may also become a problem. For example, confidential information, copied contents, and advertising links may be content you may wish to hide from search engines. In the past, it could be hidden by the methods of password protection, putting the content back on a table, using JS / Ajax, or using Flash, etc. However, according to a recent article from Google Webmaster blog, these methods are no longer 100% effective.Using FlashGoogle began trying to crawl Flash content a few years ago. In fact, simple text content has been able to be crawled, while the links in Flash can also be tracked.FormGoogle spiders can not only fill in a form but also capture the POST request page. This has long been seen from the Google blog.JS / AjaxJS with links had not been considered to be search engine friendly and the view was it can stop spiders crawling. But a couple of years ago we saw that JS links does not stop Google spiders crawling the URL that appears. Not only will links in the JS will be crawled, but also simple JS can be performed to find more URLs as well.A few days ago it was found that many website comments which use the Facebook Comments plug-in were crawled and listed, even though the plug-in itself is AJAX. This is good news. Most websites can benefit greatly with the Facebook comments plug-in, yet the only problem is that the comments are implemented by AJAX, which means they cannot be crawled, and product reviews to be listed is one of the purposes (producing original content). In the past we have no solution but only to put Facebook comments plug-in and open the comments feature of the shopping cart itself. Now, since Facebook comments can be listed, we don’t need two sets of comments on functionality.Robots fileAnother way to ensure the content is not to be listed is to setup a prohibit command in the robots file. There is a disadvantage in this in that the page strength will drop, and even though the content is not listed, the webpage will only accept page strength from links but not transfer page strength.NofollowNofollow does not guarantee no listing. Even if all your site links to the page have NF added, there is no guarantee that people will not get hold of the site and link to the page. Search engines can still find the page.Meta Noindex + FollowTo transfer page strength and prevent being listed at the same time, we can use the meta noindex and meta follow on the page. This page will not be listed, but can transfer page strength. Indeed, it is also a good solution. The only problem is it will waste the time for the spider to crawl the site.How to make a website page not to be listed is a question worth considering. If you are not realizing the seriousness, you can think about how much duplicate content and low quality content there is and whether this will penalize your site if indexed. Sometimes you may not want search engines to index certain pages but still wish to maintain the content because users find it convenient and useful.Tags: China, SEO, Site ArchitectureCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4164,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/social-media-china/will-sina-microblog-be-the-first-successful-solomo-in-china/','Will Sina Microblog be the first successful SoLoMo in China','','An outline of the main players in China competing for the SoLoMo space (Social+Local+Mobile) in China. Players include Renren.com, DianPing.com, Xiaomi, and Sina Microblog...','What is SoLoMo?SoLoMo is a fashionable term in these last few months which has been coined by John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. He summed up the three hottest keywords to express his view of Internet development in the future. His view can be delivered as a formula: SoLoMo = Social (So) + Local (Lo) + Mobile (Mo). Internet Practitioners agree with the concept because they believe that people who indicate their locations through Mobile phone LBS (Location-Based Service), and who share information with others, will be one of the driving forces in the development of the internet in the future.Source: http://gamespiel.typepad.com/my-blog/One example of SoLoMo is ARG’s (Alternative Reality Games) which are becoming ever more popular with people around the world.The current situation of China’s SoLoMoSoLoMo – “So”Renren.com is a “China Facebook” version. It first started on campus and soon defeated Kaixin.com and Wealink.com. As of April this year Renren.com had over 31 million active users. Renren.com has also listed on the NYSE in 2011. It seems to me that the biggest advantage for marketers on Renren.com is the network real name system which is propitious to differentiate users and achieve precision marketing. At present, Renren.com has built up cooperation with Mobile phone operators in order to combine social networking and LBS, indicating Renren.com is striding forward to SoLoMo mode.SoLoMo – “Lo”Dainping.com is a customer review website providing customer guidance on local life in China, based on millions of reviews. Dianping.com covers 2,300 cities and 1.5 million businesses including food & dining, wedding services, beauty & spa, hotels, entertainment, and shopping. Dianping.com was started in 2003 and now has 42 million monthly users and over 500 million monthly page views. There are four profitable directions for Dianping.com: PPC; coupons; group buy and mobile Internet. The Dainping.com SoLoMo strategy is relying on public comments and user evaluations for its popularity and is well placed to take advantage of the trend in SoLoMo.SoLoMo – “Mo”Xiaomi is a mobile phone designed by the Xiaomi Tech Company in China which has copied Apple’s successful mode in developing an operating system and applications based on Mobile phone platforms. Xiaomi plans to use MI (a mobile immediate communication application) to expand the market, but it has to compete with HTC and Sina Microblog. Whether Xiaomi will dominate the Mobile phone market in China or not is the most important factor before taking on SoLoMo.Sina Microblog Revision and UpgradesAs we know, Sina Microblog already has over 200 million users, meanwhile, weibo.com comes into the worlds’ top 10 visited websites. Sina Microblog combines strong social and localization components. Moreover, it has good connections with mobile Internet. It seems Sina Microblog is an ideal place to develop SoLoMo. But the disadvantage of Sina Microblog is not enough “SNS”. It means the formation of community networks is not strong in Sina Microblog.With this apparent disadvantage in mind, Sina Microblog has made some revisions to its platform. For example, the personal version of the user interface will enable users to make a choice of having two columns or three columns. Further, they have added a small pop-up box at the right corner for IM messaging and they have optimized desktop pictures, video viewing windows, and so on. The revision has improved and perfected the Microblog; for which I want to emphasize the IM function. This will be a helpful move to increase user interaction and community formation. Besides, Sina Microblog has added new applications for the iPhone in October. Among the applications, I think the brilliant one is to share location information with friends. From the upgrades of Sina Microblog, it can be seen that it is not only focusing on website functionality but is also making efforts in the Mobile area. Therefore, we can see Sina is increasing its speed towards becoming a player in SoLoMo.So who will be the first SoLoMo winner in China?Since the emergence of SoLoMo, China’s Internet industry is recognizing SoLoMo will become the future trend of the internet. Many companies are competing in the SoLoMo direction to find an effective profit mode. But the distance to be successful in SoLoMo is still far. Who will be the first SoLoMo winner in China? It’s too early to say. But for now, for a personal guess, if Sina Microblog continues to make progress, it might be the first local Internet Company to succeed in SoLoMo.Tags: China, Dianping, Microblogs, Renren, Sina Microblog, Social Local Mobile, Social Media, SoLoMo, XiaomiCategory: Social, Social Media China','article'),(4166,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/dianping/','Dianping - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Will Sina Microblog be the first successful SoLoMo in China What is SoLoMo?

(Baidu still retained the largest share of 81.48%).Sogou is a search engine based in China and is the third largest by market share of search after Baidu and Google. Earlier this year, as my colleague Daniel wrote, Sogou had overtaken another Chinese based search engine, SOSO, to become number three. Last year Sogou was separated from Sohu.com to become an independent company and they have tried hard to improve their performance and now seem to be making positive inroads.The above graph from CNZZ shows the China search market share for the last two months for Google and Sogou. It can be seen that Google appears to be losing market share quite significantly while Sogou is slightly increasing its share during this two month period. If this trend continues, then it would appear to be only a matter of time before Sogou overtakes Google permanently and becomes the number two search engine in China.Sougou as a search engine offers numerous different search types other than websites including images, maps, video, news, music, blogs, and answers. It also has its own internet browser and Chinese input tool which has helped its growth in popularity in China. With Google’s continued slide in China market share occurring, and smaller players like Sogou and SOSO gaining market share, as my colleague Daniel also said in his post, these search engines now need to be taken into account for a holistic SEO strategy in China. Below are some tips which may be useful for doing SEO on Sogou:1. Try to make the sites authoritativeSogou use an index called “SogouRank” to evaluate a website and SogouRank has a close relationship with the website’s authority. Therefore, striving to become experts in your industry will do a lot to have good rankings on Sogou.2. Focus on original contentSogou is very concerned about original website content and has even developed its own spam detection algorithm called R-SpamRank which identifies and assigns spam values to web pages based on link analysis. Therefore try to provide more high quality original content and do not copy content from other sites. However, if your content is being cited by high authority sites, Sogou may give your pages a very high ranking.3. Save time on Meta Description writingSogou pays more attention to page titles and the actual content on sites so there is no real need to write sophisticated Meta descriptions if you are only doing SEO for Sogou.4. Avoid mirror pages and sitesSince Sogou attaches great importance to original content, do not create mirror pages or sites.5. Improve the user experienceThe ultimate goal of all sites is to serve users, to improve the user experience and search engine friendliness. Think more about how to serve users better while at the same time not cheating search engines.To tweak Google Analytic’s tracking code to support Sogou, please see my colleague Vennie’s post on this subject.Tags: China, Content Optimization, Content Writing, Google, Google China, Onsite Optimization, Search Engine Market Share, SEO, Sogou, Sohu, SosoCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4174,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/content-optimization/','Content Optimization - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Time to Pay Attention on Sogou SEO in China During the recent National Day holiday in China, Sogou temporarily overtook Google for the first time in the China search market in terms of market share relating to search volume: According to CNZZ, a leading Chinese web analytics tool, Sogou had a market share of search of 5.55% on October 6th, while the share for [...] Read More Tags: China, Content Optimization, Content Writing, Google, Google China, Onsite Optimization, Search Engine Market Share, SEO, Sogou, Sohu, Soso 5 SEO areas to watch out for in the China market in 2011 SEO is no longer a new term to Chinese online marketing practitioners like it was four or five years ago.

With the integration of Yahoo Japan using Google’s algorithm, the focus on conducting SEO with Google’s algorithm in mind has never been greater.As we all know, quality incoming links from relevant sources are valued more highly by Google than are irrelevant links. Historically, Yahoo has not placed as much importance on the incoming link quality in determining rankings, so as Yahoo is the dominant search engine in Japan but is now using Google’s algorithm, it is more important than ever to focus more on quality links. It is better to get 1 quality link from a good relevant site than 100 links from an irrelevant site (you might even get penalized with this method if you consistently get links from such spam sites).So how to get good quality links? Content!Spend time reaching out to bloggers in Japan with the same interests as the field your company is in. If you can develop good relationships with bloggers and you have good content they are likely to write about your company and link to your site as well. Remember, content is your treasure. Make sure you have good quality informative content in your site and don’t expect to receive many incoming links or to rank highly in the search engine results pages if you don’t.With the Panda updates and algorithm changes Google consistently has, the search engines are only getting smarter. If you want to expand your back-links, make an interesting site that is useful for people as well as write more content, articles and news that is interesting and informative. This is also now the case for Japan as previously it has been for many other countries where Google dominates the search market.Like I mentioned in my previous post, choose the right keywords and optimize correctly and have fresh new content updated regularly and people will find it useful and interesting and they will link to your site and spread the word for you about your products and services as well.“There is no shortcut to success”Tags: Content Writing, Japan, Link Building, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Japan','article'),(4177,'http://www.searchblog.asia/2011/10/page/2/',' October 2011 Archives - 2/2 - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Baidu new product – Xinzhi Baidu Xinzhi is a search-based social network platform located in China and which launched on June 8, 2011.

Here in this article I will provide some tips regarding choosing subdomains or subdirectories to organize content of your site.How search engines treat subdomains and subdirectories?A URL like news.example.com is a URL using a subdomain and news.example.com here is a subdomain under top-level domain example.com. An example for a subdirectory is a URL like example.com/article/, where here the directory article is a subdirectory under the web root.From the perspective of search engines, content on different domains or subdomains are treated as content from different websites. And content on the same domain or subdomain is treated as content from the same site. For example, content on example.com, news.example.com and buy.example.com is treated as coming from different sites. Content on example.com/news/ and example.com/buy/ is treated as from the same site example.com.Subdomains or Subdirectories?Since all subdomain pages are treated as independent sites from each other and from top-level domain sites, they won’t affect the search engine ranking between each other. But when considering creating more content to generate more traffic from search engines, we should try to take advantage of existing resources. Search engines tend to give higher ranking to pages from old sites that are trusted or have higher weight and reputation.If you have a good old site and consider adding more content on same topic, using subdirectories may make the new pages get good rankings more quickly. But if the content you are going to add is rich enough to support an independent site or the subject is new content which is not relevant to the existing content, then you should consider using subdomains to organize it.Another thing to consider is whether it is convenient for you/your company to maintain the sites, because sites using subdirectories just often put the code in same space but subdomains might not and might require different codes or CMS and sometimes might even be hosted on different servers. Content in subdirectories is much easier to edit or change and content entered into different subdomains is a little more difficult to manage.In summary – Best Practice1. If the content is not rich enough to support a new site, put it in subdirectories under the old site to make it get good rankings quickly; when the content is rich enough, then consider transferring it to a subdomain for easier management.2. Use subdomains to organize content which is different from content on other pages.3. Avoid distributing duplicated content between different domains/subdomains.4. Avoid abusing subdomains. Do not use subdomains to set up a large number of sites if you don’t have enough content to support the sites’ topic.Tags: International, SEO, Site Architecture, sub-directories, SubdomainsCategory: SEO, SEO Global','article'),(4182,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/sub-directories/','sub-directories - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' When to use Subdomains or Subdirectories Last time when I discussed SEO strategy for multi-regional and multilingual sites, I mentioned briefly the topics of when to use subdomain’s and when to choose subdirectories.

In the last year, Baidu has made several bold moves to enter the more commercialized and mature online business sectors, including property, recruiting and travel.Competition Heats UpIn August 2011, Baidu launched property platform – leju.baidu.com; in April 2011, its recruiting platform – rencai.baidu.com went live; and in May it launched its travel platform – lvyou.baidu.com. Though there are many strong incumbents in each sector, such as Soufun and Anjuke in property, 51job and ChinaHR in recruiting, Ctrip and Qunar in travel, Baidu still cannot say no to the high profit margins of property and the valid and complete user information of online recruiting platforms as well as the high financial liquidity of travel.How Baidu Forms Competitive Products Though Baidu has loads of cash, it still takes time and resources to build up good products, especially in the above 3 competitive sectors. The answer in building competitive products for Baidu is its Open Data Platform, launched in August 2010. Webmasters and developers can submit their structured data and applications to Baidu’s Open Data Platform. Once approved, their data and applications will be displayed in preferred positions on Baidu SERP (Search Engine result Page).We can see from the picture above, that open.baidu.com is listed at the top of the organic results when querying “Recruiting Client Service in Beiijing”. Among the top 5 results of the open.baidu.com there are 4 from ganji.com and 1 from 58.com, both of which are local online directory providers. With the data from those directories and other smaller online recruitment platforms, Baidu is slowly building up the data of both recruiters and job searchers, which will later be used for its own recruiting platform rencai.baidu.com.Does Baidu Prefer Its Own ProductsBoth rencai.baidu.com and lvyou.baidu.com are in beta stage, so we cannot see much of their presence on the search engine yet. The officially live leju.baidu.com is still in infancy, as we can see from its navigation with sections from external websites, such as from Sina and Dichan.com. This is not to mention its website structure is still a bit messy, jumping from leju.com, leju.baidu.com, to house.baidu.com. Due to this, we don’t see much of its presence either at this stage but I am sure we will in future.SummaryDoes Baidu give preference to its own products ranking in property, recruiting and travel search?No.Does Baidu give preference to its Open Platform ranking in property, recruiting and travel search?Yes.Does Baidu use Open Platform Data to build up its products?Yes.Will Baidu prefer its own products (after streamlining) for rankings in property, recruitment and travel search in the future?Maybe.Tags: Baidu, Baidu Open Data Platform, China, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4186,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/baidu-open-data-platform/','Baidu Open Data Platform - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' How Far Baidu Will Go to Monopolize the Internet Market in China We’ve seen Baidu being accused by Hudong for unfair competition as early as in 2008, when they were fighting for Zhidao, a Q&A platform, which is basically a community with low financial liquidity.

However, when doing SEO for keyword research, they are often not aware that the estimated search volumes they get from Google Adwords or Baidu Phoenix are not just for web page searches. Those estimated figures include queries in Image Searches, News Searches and other search functions. Image search at least possesses 15% of search volumes. So today, I’d like to talk about how to do image SEO in some simple ways.1. Create image XML sitemap and put the XML file path in Robot.txt fileSearch Engine Optimizers often will create the XML sitemap for their websites. However, only very few of them will create an XML sitemap for the images on the site as well. There are some standards for image XML’s first introduced by Google. Below is an example that shows how an image XML sitemap might look.<?xml version=”1.0″ encoding=”UTF-8″?> <urlset xmlns=”http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9″ xmlns:image=”http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-image/1.1″> <url> <loc>http://example.com/sample.html</loc> <image:image> <image:loc>http://example.com/image.jpg</image:loc> </image:image> <image:image> <image:loc>http://example.com/photo.jpg</image:loc> </image:image> </url></urlset>Other than the tags used in the example above, there are also other XML tags that help Search Engines to understand the picture.<image:image> is the compulsory tag that contains the image information. It allows up to 1000 images listed under one page.<image:loc> is the compulsory tag used for image location.<image:caption> is optional. You can write a short description to explain what’s on the image.<image:geo_location> is optional and it to give the location of the image. Normally you can put city, country.<image:title> is also an optional tag, and it is for the title of the image. I would suggest including keyword in the title.<image:license> is optional as well for the URL for the image license.Once you create such an image XML sitemap, do indicate it in the Robots.txt file just like you would normally do for a website XML sitemap. For Google, you can also submit it in the Google Webmaster Tool.2. Give the image files a meaningful nameHuangshan-sunset.jpg definitely makes more sense than IMG000001.jpg to Search Engine. It’s recommended to use meaningful names and or relevant keywords for images.3. Use the HTML code properly when inserting any imageThe best code to insert for an image is to contain all the necessary code tags, for example <img src=” http://example.com/huangshan-sunset.jpg” width=”400″ height=”300″ alt=”huangshan sunset” title=”huangshan sunset” />.4. Include your keywords in the anchor text to imagePeople often use the text “click to see enlarged picture” as the anchor text, however this is not helping search engines understand what’s on the picture. The best practice is to include some text that is relevant to what’s on the image, for example “click to see the enlarged picture of Huangshan Sunset”.5. Optimize the text around the image.Search Engine’s cannot figure out what’s on an image, so they rely on the content surrounding the image as well. So it’s better to have descriptive text related to the image around the image as well.Tags: Baidu, China, Image Search, Onsite Optimization, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4189,'http://www.searchblog.asia/global/seo-global/seo-strategy-for-multi-regional-and-multilingual-sites/','SEO Strategy for Multi-regional and Multilingual Sites','','Suggestions from our SEO Specialist Felix Cen on how to best structure Multi-Regional and Multi-Lingual websites for SEO in China, Japan, Thailand, etc','1. Multi-regional and Multilingual SitesIf a website explicitly targets its users in different countries/regions, it can be called a multi-regional website, for example, a website that serves people from both Singapore and China. Additionally, a multilingual website obviously means any website that offers content in more than one language, like for example in English and Chinese. Many websites are both multi-regional and multilingual, e.g. a site might have different versions for Thailand and Singapore and, provide both Thai and English for the Thai, and both Chinese and English for the Singaporeans.It is quite common for global companies to set up such websites to serve their clients all around the world. So it’s an important Search Engine Optimization (SEO) issue to deal with when handling multi-regional and multilingual sites in order to make them search engine friendly.2. How Search Engines Determine the LanguageAs Google has declared, it uses only the visible content on the webpage to determine its language. Not any source code information such as “lang” attributes would help Google determine the language. When considering the language issue, search engines won’t take a whole site as an assessment unit. What they care about is that what is a specific webpage’s language is, that is, search engines determine language only at the page level.To avoid making search engines confused and to help them determine the language correctly, only one language should be used on each page, both in content and navigation. The website can include web pages in several languages, but every page should include only one language.3. Targeting Site to a Specific Country and Taking Advantage of Localization For search engines, they always try to show users the best possible search results, and generally those results are going to be pages that are localized for the user’s location and/or in the user’s language, which means that if the search engines think that your site serves a specific region/language, pages on your site tend to be returned by search engines and might have better ranking in that region/language.If search engines understand your site’s target country, this may also help to improve the quality of the search results and rankings for your site’s pages. The following elements will help search engines to determine a website’s targeted country:* Country-code top-level domain names, or ccTLDs, for example, .cn would tell search engines that the site is targeting in China and .jp is for Japan.* Geotargeting settings. Geotargeting means determining the geographic location of a website. You can use this function provided by Google Webmaster Tools to indicate to Google which country your site is targeting.* Server location, which is determined by the IP address of the server.For sites in single languages or targeting only one country, it’s much easier to make them understand by search engines than for multi-regional and multilingual sites. To keep the coherence of the web content and make it easier to geotarget parts of your site to different regions, content of multi-regional and multilingual sites in different languages should be organized well.Using a good URL structure coordinate with different language is a good way to help geotarget parts of the sites. Below is a table which shows several URL structure for optional:4. Common Problems and Best SEO Practice for Multi-regional and multilingual SitesFrom the perspective of search engines, pages that provide the same content in different languages would not be considered as duplicate content, and are actually quite user-friendly to provide content in different languages to visitors from different countries or regions.From another perspective, by creating several language versions of the webpage and helping search engines to index them all, would provide the website a better chance to get traffic from regions using different languages.One common problem involving multi-lingual sites is the automatic redirection based on the user’s perceived language (based on the IP address/cookie/browser language, etc.), which could prevent users and search engines from viewing all versions of the website, especially when there is not a cross-link between each language version of the site.Another more serious problem is that the website server can return different versions of the web pages in the same URL according to different users’ perceived languages. This may confuse search engines and visitors as well as to what is the exact language and content of the page (only one specific URL). To make the site search engine friendly, different content must be used for each different URL.Since we know that there is no problem for search engines to determine the pages’ language if there isn’t more than one language within each webpage, we can organize different language parts of the multi-regional and multi-lingual site well to help search engines understand each part and thereby help the sites pages get better rankings.Below are some steps you can follow when planning or optimizing your multi-regional and multilingual sites:* Decide to use country-code top-level domain names or sub domains or subdirectories to organize different parts of the site. Choose ccTLDs, subdirectories or sub domains depending on your company’s specific situation, such as your company’s budget, site scale and so on.* Create different versions of web pages on the site in different languages to suit different visitors. Each page should be created in only one language and each language version of the pages should have their own URLs.* Organize pages in same language together and put them into different country-level domains or sub directories or sub domains.* Set up Cross-links between different language parts of the site and link each language version together.* Add the site to Google Webmaster Tool and set geotargeting for each part to indicate their targeted countries.Tags: Geotargeting, International, mult--regional websites, multi-lingual websites, SEO, Site Architecture, sub-directories, SubdomainsCategory: SEO, SEO Global','article'),(4191,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/mult-regional-websites/','mult–regional websites - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' SEO Strategy for Multi-regional and Multilingual Sites 1.

What a huge difference compared to those international company websites, which have the situation the other way around!By looking into the structure, sitemap, links, etc, I summarized a few tips that might be useful for Baidu Indexation.1. Flat Website Architecture/structureBoth Anjuke and Mytophome use lot of sub-domains. Each city is assigned with a sub-domain of city.domain.com. In total Anjuke has 25 city based sub-domains. Mytophome has 8 city based plus function based subdomains, such as ask, news and maps, etc. Since Baidu spider’s crawling performance decreases more when the longer URL is, architecture with sub-domains that makes the whole website flatter and URL shorter is preferred by Baidu spider.2. HTML Sitemap PagesBaidu hasn’t launched its Webmaster Tools yet, so sitemap.xml and robots.txt that are used to submit to Google Webmaster Tools, are not working well with Baidu spider. The temporary solution for Baidu spider is to go to html sitemap page. Each individual city-based sub-domain of Anjuke has an independent html sitemap page, so in total it has 25 sitemap html pages. Such a large number of sitemap pages helps the Baidu spider to index.3. Local Link BuildingLocal link building plays an important role in Baidu indexation. According to Open Site Explorer, Anjuke has 164,005 offsite links and Mytophome has 15,080. Such large numbers of offsite links are crucial to support the same level of web pages getting indexed by Baidu.4. Language and ContentBaidu spider tends to crawl Chinese, both traditional and simplified, and Japanese. It does crawl English pages too, but its algorithm usually gives more preference to web pages that provide translation services, as most Baidu visitors tend to look for the Chinese meaning of the English terms. Therefore, localizing your page well by putting Chinese in the title, meta, H tags and text is very crucial.5. Baidu MapsThe Baidu algorithm ususally favors its own products, as we have seen from the lawsuit that Hudong accused Baidu for making Baidu Baike rank higher than Hudong. This can be applied to Baidu maps, as the Baidu spider tends to crawl websites more often with Baidu products. As location matters for online property searching, Anjuke uses maps to guide users to find their apartments. Baidu maps was opted for by Anjuke over Google maps, as it tends to get better results in location-based terms’ search. Just like registering your location on Google maps will benefit from Google universal search, integrating Baidu maps into the system will definitely help Anjuke’s properties listed on maps to achieve a better position than its competitors.Tags: Baidu, China, SEO, Site IndexationCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4195,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/site-indexation/','Site Indexation - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' China SEO Tips to Improve Your Indexation on Baidu I have recently checked several top Chinese property websites, which of course focus on Baidu, as their visitors are the mass audiences who tend to go to Baidu, and found that their results on Baidu are amazing.

According to a recent post from Lee, he reveals how the Baidu spider treats different HTTP status codes and provides some suggestions when using those status codes.404 Not FoundIf the URL returns the status code 404, Baidu will think the page is no longer in service and normally will also remove the page from the search results. If the Baidu spider discovers this URL again, it will not crawl the page.503 Service UnavailableIf the URL returns the 503 status code, Baidu will think the website is temporarily not able to be visited. It’s normally caused by the temporary shutdown of the website or limited bandwidth. The Baidu spider will not remove the URL from its database and will visit again later. By the next time the spider comes, if it returns normal, the spider will crawl the site as normal. If it still returns 503, the Baidu spider will still keep coming back a few times. However, if the page keeps returning the 503 status code, Baidu will treat it as a broken link and remove it from its search results.403 ForbiddenIn the case when the URL returns the code 403, Baidu will think the website is forbidden to visit the page for the time being. Under such circumstances, if it’s a new URL to the Baidu spider, Baidu will not crawl it and will come back again later to check. If it’s an existing URL, Baidu will not remove it immediately and will come back again later to check. However, if the Baidu spider keeps getting the 403 status code, it will eventually remove the URL from its search results.301 Moved PermanentlyIf the status code 301 is returned, Baidu will think the page is redirected to the new URL. Using a 301 is recommended when migrating a website, changing a domain or updating a website. Lee also admits that it takes a bit longer for Baidu to process 301’s.Lee also made some suggestions on choosing the right HTTP Status Code for different situations as follows:-1. When the website is temporarily down and people cannot open web pages, try using 503’s instead of 404’s. The 503 tells the Baidu spider the site is temporarily down and please come back later.2. When you experience bandwidth pressure from spider crawling, again use a 503 rather than a 404 to make sure the spider will come at another time.3. Sometimes you want Baidu to index completed pages and reviewed content. Then you can use the 403 status code for the new content or pages until you complete and review the pages.4. When changing domains or migrating websites, use 301’s to redirect the old URL to new URL.Tags: Baidu, Baidu Spider, China, Robots, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4198,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/shanghai-surprise-at-ses-shanghai/','Shanghai Surprise at SES Shanghai','','An overview from Richard regarding his speaking engagament at SES Shanghai where he spoke about the impotance of site architecture for search engine optimization in China.','Shanghai SES was at the end of last month and I’ve got to say it was an amazing turnout and certainly larger than the first Asian SES event held in Hong Kong last September.

Many Baidu SEO’s find themselves suffering as their old tricks of building up multi-websites and selling offsite links to their clients websites don’t work anymore. Since then the talk has been that link building is not that important now and Baidu cares more about the freshness and originality of content with user experience being the key.So the question is how much value can link building still bring to Baidu Optimization? We took some of the Q&A from webmasters and Baidu engineer, Lee, to seek the answer.Q1: Does Baidu spider crawl URL’s that don’t exist?Lee: Baidu spider crawls URL’s that exists on the internet. If Baidu spider crawls a large number of URLs that don’t exist in your website, there might be two reasons. 1. Certain pages of your site use incorrect URL’s to link to other pages. 2. Other websites link to your website with the wrong URL.The Take Out: Baidu crawls other website links to identify your pages.Q2: I already set Robots.txt to disallow Baidu spider from visiting my site, so why are my pages are still displayed in the search engine result pages (“SERP”) of Baidu?Lee: If other websites link to your pages that you disallow Baidu spider to crawl, those pages will still be displayed in the SERPs of Baidu. But the real content of those pages wouldn’t be crawled, indexed and shown by Baidu, because the content displayed in the SERPs of Baidu is only the description of your pages by other websites.The Take Out: Baidu crawls other website links to find your page URL’s and displays your pages with the description appearing on other sites.Q3: Why is my page title in the SERP of Baidu different from the actual page title?Lee: The main reason could be that Baidu spider fails to extract the title tag, due to web design issues, for example sites designed with flash or Ajax, or because of Robots.txt disallow (Baidu won’t crawl the pages but will keep the URL), so the system scrapes text from other places and uses that text as the title.The Take Out: Baidu crawls other website links to find your page URL and displays your page titles using text from other sites.From the above Q&A, we can see that the Baidu spider doesn’t comply with the commands from Robots.txt as well as the Google Robot does. Instead of simply being able to submit a sitemap.xml file to Google Webmaster tools, Baidu tends to depend on a wide variety of offsite links, as demonstrated above, to identify new pages or websites which have emerged online, and adds them to its indexation.Hence Google best practice is not enough to increase your websites footprint on Baidu, especially for those multinational company websites, who tend to focus on Google only, and have multi-language content, which itself is a barrier for Baidu spider to visit. So link building really does continue to matter for companies in improving their presence on the major Chinese search engine, Baidu.Tags: Baidu, China, Link Building, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4202,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/beware-of-blackhat-seo-agencies-in-china-taking-advantage-your-website/','Beware of Blackhat SEO Agencies in China taking advantage of your website','','A guide from Daniel Cai on how to keep your website in China safe from hackers using tools to insert links to their own sites from your website.','When I am doing research for competitor link profiles, I often see some websites which have been hacked by other blackhat SEO agencies which have inserted some code to provide links for other websites.

However, few of them work really well in the China Market. If you are doing SEO in China, you might have problem to find a good SEO application to help you. But as a SEO practitioner, don’t forget the search engine itself is one of the best tools. There are a number of query operators that we can use in the process of Search Engine Optimization. I will introduce you to how to use these advanced query operators to do competitor analysis, keyword research and link building.Use query operator to help Competitor AnalysisIt’s very important to indentify your competitors in the process of SEO, and you can explore this from two angles, keyword and content relevancy. To find those pages that compete on the same keyword, you can use the Google query “intitle:keyword –site:domainname.com”.To find those websites that Google thinks have the most relevant content to your website, you can use Google the query “related:domainname.com”. The search results will give you an idea who your neighbours are.Use query operators to help Keyword ResearchGoogle queries “Intitle” and “Inanchor” are often used to research the keyword competition. “Intitle:keyword” is to find pages that have the keyword in the page title. “Inanchor:keyword” is to find the pages that have the most backlinks with the keyword in the anchor text. To better identify your competitors for a certain keyword, you can even combine these two operators together to search, “Inanchor:keyword Intitle:keyword”. The search results will reveal those real competitors who have been optimizing for this keyword.“Intitle” command works in Baidu as well. However, Baidu does not support the “inanchor” command.When you try to expand your keyword list, you can use the Google query operator “*” and “~”. “*” can be used as a wildcard, for example “*keyword” or “keyword*”, to find out more keywords. “~keyword” makes Google tell you what keywords Google thinks are related to your keyword. “*” and “~” works fine for Chinese terms, but is not as good as for English keywords.Finding the most appropriate landing page is often the next step after you have a list of keywords. Use “site:domainname.com keyword” in Google, and Google will tell you what page is most relevant to the keyword. The search will be based on those pages that are indexed by Google, so this should not be the only factor when you are deciding on proper landing pages. If you have already decided your landing page, performing this query can also help you to find out what pages are possibly competing with your landing page for a certain keyword. You might want to avoid the competition happening on your own site.Baidu supports “Site:” command. However, the results are not that accurate, so I tend to use Google.Use query operators to help Link BuildingThe most efficient way to find linking prospects is to find those links pointing to your competitors. If they can link to your competitors, then they could possibly link to you, too. I often use Yahoo to search for the competitors’ backlinks by using query “link:competitordomain.com”. Baidu does not support “link:” command and Google shows limited results, hence I often use Yahoo rather than other search engines. The other way is to find those forums or blogs that are most relevant to your keyword, and see if there is any opportunity for link building. You can use the Google query “inurl:forum keyword” or “inurl:blog keyword” to generate a list of link prospects.In conclusion, query operators are the very basic tools to give you the insight into what search engines see and how they “think”, and so they are probably one of the best tools as well.Tags: Advanced Query Operators, Baidu, China, Google, Google China, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4207,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/advanced-query-operators/','Advanced Query Operators - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' How to use search engines advanced query operators to help on SEO in China Today, SEO practitioners are exposed to many powerful SEO applications.

Many companies have already been noticing the importance of SEO and started doing SEO. Although there is no huge change on the SEO theories for past few years, the search engine algorithm’s keep improving and so do SEO techniques. In this article, I would like to talk about what an SEO practitioner needs to be alert to for the China market in 2011.Search Engines favor original contentI think this point has been raised hundreds and thousands of times by SEO masters and gurus. If inbound links were once the most important factor in influencing the ranking of a website, content is now overtaking inbound links to become the most important factor affecting a website’s performance in today’s major search engines. This is also the reason why I would like to underline this point again. People always talk about how Google likes original content, but the truth is that Baidu likes original content a lot more than Google does. Websites full of duplicated content will find it very hard to survive in Baidu. Such websites may even get “killed” from Baidu’s indexation. Baidu favors original content. Original content not only assures fast indexation in Baidu, but also a good ranking. Google has also made a big algorithm update earlier this year called “Panda” to penalize the content farms and eliminate low quality “spun” content.Be careful with your link building Not only does Google hate cheating on link building, it gets on Baidu’s nerves as well. Baidu made a big change to its algorithm to reduce the inbound linking effect from link farms at the end of last year. Those link farm websites with the same web hosting and same registration information were penalized by Baidu. Google has made its move against such kinds of links as well. Early this year, JC Penny was penalized by Google because of its unethical linking sources. Link building has never been a one night job. There is no real shortcut on the road of link building. The best link building sources for Baidu in China come from reputable high quality content websites, but it takes time and hard work to develop such high quality links.A good site structure is more important than the URLThere is always a misunderstanding in relation to URL’s and website structures. Some people still judge website structures based on the URL. A URL like www.domain.com/folder1/folder2/folder3/page.html does not really tell you the depth of the page. The depth of the page is really determined by the clicks it takes to get there from the home page. A search engine friendly website structure makes the new pages get indexed a lot faster and enables page value to flow down to each page. A good website structure is considered more important than the actual URL. It once was an advantage to include the keywords in the URL to gain a better ranking. However, the advantage of having keywords in the URL is getting smaller. Website structure optimization is the cornerstone to achieving good indexation and keyword rankings.CRO (conversion rate optimization)Conversions are the real reason behind everything. SEO does not stop once No 1 rankings are achieved. We need to look into the web analytics to analyze user behavior and page performance in order to fully take advantage of the organic traffic that is brought by the work of SEO. Keyword research should also be an on-going activity so as to explore the keywords that bring conversions and keep the wheels of SEO running.Social and SEOGoogle and Bing already claim that they consider the links from Twitter. It won’t be too long before we hear Baidu is also considering links from Social Networks as part of its ranking algorithm. Baidu users can now update their microblogs from the Baidu search box which link to the micro-blogging services on QQ, Sohu and Netease thus far.Does this indicate that Baidu will take social into its algorithm? No doubt. Baidu is planning something big related to Social and as we all know there has been a lot of speculation recently about its discussions with Facebook for a potential new Social Networking site in China. As SEO practitioners, we should start setting up accounts on microblogs and testing them so we can be prepared for further changes to Baidu’s algorithm in relation to social media and blogging links and content.As long as we think about the users and customers, deliver useful information and provide good customer experiences, the website will be liked by users as well as search engines. After all, what search engines really care about is the user experience. Add to that the effort on SEO and I am sure you will reap the harvest of your hard work.Tags: Baidu, China, Content Optimization, Content Writing, Link Building, SEO, Site Architecture, Social Media, Social SearchCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4212,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/seo-japan/are-you-choosing-the-right-keyword-for-your-japanese-seo/','Are you choosing the right keyword for your Japanese SEO','','An explanation of the difficulties in choosing the correct keywords in Japanese to get the best ROI for your Japanese SEO campaigns','For any native English speaker, Japanese is one of the most difficult languages to learn and especially if you want to expand your market share by doing SEO in Japan, this can be a huge challenge. Japanese constitutes of 3 types of characters, “Hiragana”, “Katakana” and “Kanji”. Depending on certain keywords or phrases, certain types of characters are used rather than the other which makes Japanese SEO even more complex.For example, if you want to target a keyword “Mobile Phone”, there are multiple ways of writing it. One would be “携帯電話” (Kanji), “携帯” (Kanji) and “ケータイ” (Katakana). By definition “携帯” means to carry, but if you search it as a keyword, most first page results in Yahoo and Google Japan will be about Mobile phones. Also the search volume for the word 携帯is higher as it is more generic.Another difficulty is that certain words in Japanese can be pronounced the same, written the same in Hiragana, and mean more or less the same. The word “あう” (Hiragana) can be written as “会う” (Kanji), “逢う” (Kanji), “遭う” (Kanji). All of these words mean “Meet”, but each word is used in different contexts. There are many translation sites like Google translate that people may rely on, but the translations given often fail to be accurate for the context and can only lead to further confusion and incorrect keywords being chosen.Japanese tends to make abbreviations in many words and one great example is the phrase mobile phone I have used. “ケータイ” is an abbreviation of “携帯電話” and when speaking most people say it in the abbreviated format rather than the full. A search result will show you some proof that there are significant search results for the abbreviation ケータイ, which are 450,000 monthly local searches, while携帯電話, has 823,000 monthly local searches. So there is enough demand and searches for the abbreviated term and because it has become so common, the word itself already stands as a strong keyword to be considered for mobile phones in Japan.The above example clearly demonstrates the difficulties in selecting the right keywords to be optimized for in Japanese since translation sites or services may not often offer abbreviated terms for specific keywords. So keyword selection in Japanese is not always straightforward and from an SEO point of view, you really want to know what keyword will provide the best ROI and often it may not be the normal term given by translation. It is therefore very important when doing SEO in Japanese to be confident in the Japanese language skills of your translators and always ask them about abbreviations and colloquialisms for the particular keywords you are targeting.For any foreigner thinking to expand or create a website targeting Japan and writing Japanese content, I will say it again “Are you choosing the right keyword?”Tags: Japan, Keyword Research, Keyword Selection, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Japan','article'),(4214,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/keyword-selection/','Keyword Selection - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Are you choosing the right keyword for your Japanese SEO For any native English speaker, Japanese is one of the most difficult languages to learn and especially if you want to expand your market share by doing SEO in Japan, this can be a huge challenge.

This was definitely not a prelude for an April fool’s day joke. In Dangdang’s announcement, Dangdang also mentioned that they are more interested in investing their PPC promotion budget into supply chain management in order to deliver better customer service to their customers. Soon enough, 360Buy, one of the biggest Chinese online electronics stores, also claimed they had ceased Baidu PPC as well.Although this announcement of Dangdang was suspected to be part of their PR strategy to soft promote their brand by taking advantage of new media, there must be other reasons for Dangdang to pull the plug on Baidu PPC. Dangdang and 360Buy only stopped their promotion in Baidu, but not in other search engines like Google, SoSo, etc. According to Qiangdong Liu, the CEO of 360buy, they need to pay Baidu 5 million RMB a year just for their brand name “京东” in PPC promotion. However, the worst part is that Baidu also sells that keyword to other 8 competitors of 360buy. All together, Baidu can make 15 million RMB a year just on those two Chinese characters. Dangdang obviously suffered the same problem before. Besides, the average PPC cost in Baidu has gone up as well. These are all the reasons why these big brands are leaving Baidu.Stopping PPC in Baidu is absolutely a smart move. For sure, Baidu cannot do any human manipulation on Dangdang and 360buy’s organic search results, otherwise Baidu will be criticized for doing so. So far, Baidu has not replied to any of these announcements. What will Baidu do? Will they just ignore it and keep walking their own path or will they make some changes?

The Search Open Platform used to require an invitation code to sign up before, however now it’s free to register for all the webmasters. So far, more than 400 resources and apps have been indexed by Search Open Platform. However, as far as I have found, not many foreign brands have reacted on the launch of this new platform. Some of them maybe haven’t figured out what to do with it and others might be not even aware of it.It is really simple to submit anyway. To use Baidu Search Open Platform, you have to sign up as a verified user first (http://open.baidu.com). Once you sign up and log in, you will then enter the admin console of Search Open Platform.Figure 1 – Baidu Search Open Platform Admin ConsoleThere are 6 templates already in it for you to choose: ecommerce, job hunting, videos, courier, customer service and downloads. Of course, you can choose “add other resource” to add the resources other than those 6 categories. Let’s take an example of adding a 400 customer service number. You will just simply need to fill in the form below. Alternatively, you could also use XML to submit as well.Figure 2 – Baidu Search Open Platform’s Customer Service Number submissionIf your submission gets approved, your result will always be shown in a good position as long as people search the target keyword you assigned.However, Baidu does have a high standard on approving the resources. To get successfully indexed, the resource that you try to submit must possess the following qualities.Unique: Your resource must be unique from others.Useful: The information must be useful to the users and related to the target keyword.Accurate: The resource must be reliable and the information that you present must be accurate.Usability: The presentation of your resource must be comprehensive to users and easy to follow. Up-to-date: It’s also very important to present the user the most up-to-date information.If you are doing search engine marketing in China, but you have not yet touched search open platform, then you’d better put that into your action plan this year.Tags: Baidu, Baidu Search Open Platform, China, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4219,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/baidu-search-open-platform/','Baidu Search Open Platform - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' How to submit your resources to Baidu Search Open Platform Baidu Search Open Platform has been introduced to the public for a while.

Many companies promote their businesses in social network websites and by doing this; solve the “one click away” strategy for users to see what the newest promotion is or what the latest products are.In Japan, Mixi.jp is still the leading social network website with more than 21 million users, compared to around 2 million users in Japan for Facebook. However, Facebook is catching up and I believe, with its fan page functionalities, is more suitable for corporate social media marketing.For Digital Marketers in Japan it is, as everywhere else, important to focus on social media to get the message out to potential customers and to engage with them and existing customers. The following is a comparison for Facebook and Mixi in Japan.Japan has traditionally had a unique online culture where people tend to keep their privacy and feel insecure disclosing their personal information online. That is one reason why Facebook first struggled in the market as their rule is to have your real name posted. Mixi however allows users to use their nick name instead. Mixi also has a functionality whereby people can check who has visited their profile as people tend to like to know who has visited their page.However, the whole model is experiencing a gradual shift. Facebook users in Japan are growing rapidly – there has been an approximately 21% increase in users from January to February this year already.Especially from a corporate point of view, many Japanese companies are starting to make fan pages on Facebook realizing that they can brand their company and reach out to millions of potential customers. At the end of the day, users want emgagement with companies in a friendly manner and companies want reviews and likes from customers to further improve.Facebook’s growing presence in Japan is also a good search engine optimization opportunity for companies in Japan and international companies wishing to expand their presence in Japan as search engines are beginning to or will eventually incorporate Facebook “likes” into ranking algorithms. Facebook is still growing in Japan, with the recent movie “Social Network” attracting even more users.Although Mixi is still the dominant social media platform in Japan, Facebook, with features such as fan pages and other unique features it provides, is definitely becoming more important for many corporate marketers in Japan and I do believe with the user growth trends being experienced, it may be just a matter of time before Facebook makes further inroads into Mixi’s dominance.Facebook is free anyway, so if you want to target Japan, it is important to customize a fan page in Japanese on the Facebook Japan site.Stats Source from: Neilson and SocialBakers.Tags: Facebook, Japan, Mixi, Social MediaCategory: Social, Social Media Japan','article'),(4222,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-a-new-seo-tool-in-china-baidu-search-open-platform/','A new SEO tool in China – Baidu Search Open Platform','','China SEO, Baidu SEO - An introduction to the Baidu Search Open Platform and the benefits of using it in SEO efforts in China...','In the same month Google announced its launch of Instant Search, China SEO practioners will be interested to know that Baidu quietly released Search Open Platform to all the webmasters and web developers. The search result is displayed in a very similar way to Google OneBox. Below is how the search result looks when we search “Shanghai weather “ in Google and Baidu.Figure 1 – Search “Shanghai weather” in Google and BaiduHowever, SEO China specialists will find that Baidu open platform is not just a replica of Google Onebox. One major difference is that Baidu open platform is free and open to all the webmasters and web developers. The process of submitting Baidu open platform is simple: choose the keyword, choose a template, set the update frequency and submit the data source. It is quite hard to get approved by Baidu though. Google Onebox touches fields like news, music, stocks, movies, and travel etc, whereas Baidu open platform touches more industries and is not just limited to information display. The various forms of information which can be displayed or inputted in the Baidu Open Search Platform are as follows:-1) Customer Service Number in open platformThis actually protects a lot of big brands, especially in the China market where telephone fraud happens quite a lot.2) Software download in open platformPeople can click on the download button in the search results to download the software they searched. The user does not even need to go the website.3) Job Search in open platformWhen searching the keyword “上海招聘” (Shanghai recruitment), there will be a search function like below shown in the result. People can type in the job that they are searching for, and they will be led to a dedicated job search page in Baidu with the list of vacancies.4) TV Search in open platformWhen searching for any TV shows, the videos on qiyi.com will be shown in the top of the result. It is worth mentioning that Qiyi.com belongs to Baidu.5) Train Information Search in open platformThe train information search function will be shown in the result when searching the keyword “列车时刻表 (train timetable)”.As you might notice from the examples above, most open platform results are displayed in the first position. Therefore, successful submission to the open platform has the advantage of getting good ranking positions and thus good overall traffic. Useful and accurate content is the key success factor for SEO China practioners to consider in getting approved and indexed in the Baidu open platform.Although we see the benefit that Baidu open platform brings to the user, there is much controversy about its stopping users going directly to the website of listed companies. For example, the user can download the software in the search result without going to the website. Webmasters believe that they will lose traffic if they develop the data source for the open platform.As I see it, it really depends on what the goal is and how you use it. If the goal is listing the product or service, then the only thing that really matters is the number of subscribers. It doesn’t really matter whether traffic is from your website or Baidu open platform, as they are just distribution channels and overall your product or service is still getting traffic. In addition, Baidu open platform should not just be the tool to get more traffic or subscribers. Companies can make good use of it and extend its potential to customer services in order to achieve better customer satisfaction. For example, camera manufacturers can create user manual data sources for different camera models.There are now more than 400 indexed resources on Baidu open platform, so are you ready to be the next one? It is in my opinion an additional useful search engine functionality to use in SEO in China for marketing and supporting your company’s products and services in China.Tags: Baidu Search Open Platform, China, Google, Google OneBox, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4224,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/google-onebox/','Google OneBox - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' A new SEO tool in China – Baidu Search Open Platform In the same month Google announced its launch of Instant Search, China SEO practioners will be interested to know that Baidu quietly released Search Open Platform to all the webmasters and web developers.

However, of interest to Chinese SEO specialists is will Google Instant or this technology have an impact in the China Market?In the short term, I would say not. One of the reasons for this is political. The Chinese government has already banned the product Google Suggest. Accordingly, Google Instant won’t be that easy to get approval from Chinese government, as it shares similarities with Google Suggest.Even if Google Instant was launched in China, I do not believe it will have a major impact on the search habits of Chinese users. This is because Baidu still controls over 70% of the search market in China and has already proven its success in catering to as well as cultivating Chinese users’ search habits.This actually brings about another question – will Baidu use similar technology in their search product? Not in the near future, I believe. Baidu have not long ago migrated their paid search platform to Phoenix Nest and will probably wish to spend more time testing and stabilizing this new system before introducing newer search technologies such as instant search. This viewpoint is also supported by the fact that Instant Search totally changes the rules of the paid search business, affecting the number of impressions and thus the click-through rate of PPC ads, which could prove counter-productive to Baidu’s introduction of the Phoenix platform. Below is a screenshot of Baidu’s PPC ads now appearing like Google’s.Figure 2 – Baidu’s PPC ad now appear like Google’sNevertheless, I believe Instant search is a trend for the search business as it saves time and guides users to more relevant results. We will, in time, see other search engines adopt similar technologies in the future.How Instant Search affects SEO in China?As Instant Search changes the way people search, so too will it change the way we do SEO, and I believe that this will also eventually apply to the China market which people doing Chinese SEO need to prepare for.Keyword research becomes even more importantInstant search populates the search terms for user when they type. This is changing users’ search habits to make them search longer keywords which get suggested. As a consequence, businesses should spend more time exploring longer tail keywords and optimizing for those keywords. Soon enough I believe we will see interesting changes in respect to this in the figures from Google keywords tools.Rank the long tail keywords in Top 5With Instant Search, search results are returned as the user is searching. It’s quite different from the traditional way of user’s browsing the search results. With instant search, user’s will be less likely to scroll down the results page when they are typing and in fact they can only see 2-5 organic search results in the first screen as they are typing. Therefore, in addition to targeting on the right long tail terms, you also have to rank them in the top 5, or you will not even be seen by the users.Good Page Titles are ImportantA well-written title could have the effect of stopping the user typing, and clicking on the search result instead. User’s are inclined to click on the results with more relevant and well-written titles. In this case, the goal of optimizing the title should not just be to include the keywords, but should also be to create a polished or attractive title line that makes people to stop and click on it.Content building is more important than link buildingAs a consequence of targeting longer tail keywords, content support becomes more important than ever. We can’t just use one page of content to optimize for many long tail keywords or variations of terms. We should think not only about how to create more useful and unique content for users, but also how to better make use of UGC (user-generated-content). Besides, the quantity of inbound links is not the most important factor, whereas diversity and relevancy of inbound links is.ConclusionIn conclusion, Instant Search will not have an immediate impact on China market, but we should all prepare for its coming at some stage. As long as we are prepared, the results from proper SEO efforts will reap handsome rewards.To know more about Google Instant, please read:http://www.google.com/instant/Tags: Baidu, China, Google, Google China, Instant Search, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4227,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/instant-search/','Instant Search - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' What’s the impact that Google Instant or Instant Search brings to China?

It comes as no surprise that Baidu is the dominant player but it’s the companies holding smaller shares of the market that are of particular interest to people engaging in Chinese SEO for the mobile market.A study earlier in the year by Analysis International demonstrated just how fragmented the market is as the chart below illustrates.Source: Analysis International 2010Here is a snapshot of five players:Yicha Yicha is an interesting one. Although originally from China, the company has been successful in Japan over the past year, with revenues of 200 million yuan. However, it has lost much of its share of search in the Chinese mobile market. From holding around 50 percent of the market in 2007 it now comes in behind Google and 3GYY in fifth place with 10.32 percent. The chairman, Liu Bin, told Tencent technology in August that the main focus for 2011 would be using their experience from Japan to re-establish the company in the Chinese market. He used Hua Wei as an example of a Chinese company that had applied a successful formula from overseas to enhance its position in China. Yicha has partnered with Tencent Soso, which may also boost its exposure in the coming year.3GYY Launched in 2007, 3GYY is similar to Yicha in that it focuses on trying to tailor the mobile search experience to the user – which is quite a contrast to the clean interface that Baidu offers. From the main screen the similarities between all the dedicated mobile search engines are obvious with the same type of information being available such as maps, MP3 search, games, and news. 3GYY has been rewarded for its efforts in the past year moving into fourth place overall overtaking Yicha.Google We might have thought that Google would be doing better in mobile search than in browser-based search, particularly with the wide adoption of Android by Chinese mobile handset manufacturers. The open source nature of Android has in fact worked against Google here and Baidu is ensuring that mobile manufacturers are in essence making Android ‘Google free’. Microsoft has been launching a similar attack with foreign handset makers, most notably with Motorola who has installed Bing as the default search engine on many of their phone models sold in China. Although Bing itself is yet to make an impact on mobile search in China, it all helps chip away at Google’s position in the market.Easou Easou, founded in 2005, had approximately 100 million yuan in revenue by 2009 with around 60 to 70 percent coming from advertising. The company has 200 staff in both Shenzhen and Beijing. After Baidu, Easou is one of the main beneficiaries of Googles’ demise in mobile search over the past 12 months. Easou has also done a good job forming partnerships in particular with Sohu in March 2010 and Taobao. The company has established a network of 30 advertising companies and around 10,000 small and medium manufacturers as clients around Southern China.Xinhua Wants to Try tooAlthough still yet to enter the market, China’s state media arm Xinhua and China Mobile announced in August this year their joint plans to launch a search engine in 2011. Many doubt whether such a search engine can succeed, but with China Mobile as the key partner we can expect some bias towards mobile search in their offering.With the total revenue from mobile Internet users expected to reach 1.86 billion yuan (iResearch) by 2012 it will be no surprise if more players emerge or companies redouble their efforts to stay in the game.Tags: 3GYY, Baidu, China, Easou, Google, Google China, Mobile, Mobile Search, Mobile SEO, Netease Youdao, SEO, Tencent Soso, Wukong, YichaCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4230,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/3gyy/','3GYY - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Who Are the Main Players in Mobile Search in China The mobile search market in China is in some ways more interesting than browser-based search, primarily because there is no company with more than a 35 percent market share.

This blog explores why...','As mentioned in my last post for those interested in Japanese SEO, the proposed alliance in Japan between Yahoo Japan and Google, whereby Google’s search and advertising technologies are being integrated into Yahoo Japan’s portal, is currently being challenged by both Microsoft and Rakuten, Japan’s largest online retailer.Both are in talks with Japan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) regarding their opposition to the alliance, with Rakuten having formally lodged a petition with the FTC requesting them to review the original decision to allow the alliance to go ahead. The FTC has now commenced an investigation and is interviewing the various parties concerned. The next infographic depicts the overall scope of the current situation as will be described in further detail below.Microsoft Concerns:The biggest concern from Microsoft is the market share in Japan. Having Yahoo Japan and Google partnering, they will be securing 90% of search business in Japan. This will strike a critical blow for them, having launched Bing back in June, a month before Yahoo Japan and Google announced its partnership.(Data taken from Nielson Online（JPN:ネットレイティングス） May 27th 2010)Rakuten’s ConcernsRakuten’s concerns are different and would appear to be more complex. They are obviously concerned about potential adverse impacts upon their business, which, being the largest online retailer in Japan, is heavily dependent upon search engines for gaining new visitors and purchasers on their site.What they seem to be saying is that the Yahoo Japan/Google tie up, resulting in a combined 90% search market share in Japan for search, could adversely impact their search results in the two search engines, and as they have further said, could potentially hinder growth of internet companies in general in Japan.Specifically, Rakuten’s Executive Officer Satoshi Seki says there is no guarantee that the two can remain independent and that it will be difficult to monitor the consequences on search results unless web search operators make more disclosure on the criteria they use for displaying such results. Juro Osawa Dow Jones Newswires 25/10/2010Conclusion:Expect strong opposition to the Yahoo Japan / Google partnership from Microsoft but especially from Rakuten, whose business could be significantly challenged at home if the FTC does ultimately allow the partnership to proceed as originally approved.Furthermore, Yahoo Japan chose Google as its partner rather than Bing because Google’s Japanese Language search capabilities were better than Bing’s in their opinion.Also partnering with Bing would only secure 60% of the market share in Japan (compared with 90% with Google) but with a corresponding decrease in the quality of services. Instead, choosing to work with Google will not only secure their own market share, but will maintain their quality services.UPDATE- 2 Dec, 2010: The FTC has now dismissed any objections to the partnership and has now formally approved it.

This blog provides two different examples and how SEO can be used to protect brand reputations...','Over the past few months, two companies contacted us with online reputation problems in China. One was in hospitality and the other was a prominent technology company. Their issues were in fact the same. When conducting searches for their brand and product terms, negative comments in bulletin board systems (BBS) in China were showing up on page one of both Google China and Baidu. For many terms, this content ranked above their own website. They understandably felt this was impacting their sales during the consideration phase of a customer’s purchase and accordingly were wondering whether some kind of Chinese SEO or Social Media reputation management strategy might be able to help them.Did They Deserve It?When doing online reputation management we think knowing if the client actually deserves what they get and assessing how serious the charges are is an important first step in deciding if you want the business or not. Both of these clients pleaded innocent. The hospitality company contested it had been “misunderstood” and for every negative comment found on a BBS, it could produce a gleaming testimonial. The technology company believed it was under attack from a competitor.The Hospitality CompanyAfter receiving a phone call from the company, we investigated its problem to see if we could help. Although we have not heard of the company before, its website looked impressive with a number of locations and medium to high-end properties.After initial investigations we found that the dissatisfaction with this company was widespread and was fragmented across scores of travel blogs and the bulletin board systems all highlighting a negative experience with the company.The deeper we went, the worse it got. Quite incredibly, whilst on holiday, people were approached and lured into tours of resorts with the promise of prizes. They were given “winning tickets” and then told in order to redeem the prize, they would have to come to the resort to collect it. Once they arrived at the resort they were taken on a tour and were told the prize would be given to them later. During the initial tour all was well. But after what they thought was the end (with their defences down) a pushy sales person would appear who would try to sell further holidays or a timeshare. In many cases people were kept for up to five hours until they surrendered or otherwise found another way to escape!After discussion with company executives about their business practices, it became clear they had no intention of changing their approach. Although the company could see that the negative search engine results were impacting its business, the executives simply wanted us to make the negative comments go away. Without any change, the company would be continually plugging the gaps as more negative content appeared. This was not the client for us!The Technology CompanyIn contrast, the technology company’s problems, while the same in nature, were for different causes. After some digging, we isolated the root cause of the problem coming from three articles written by a moderately prominent blogger in China’s technology sector. The technology company in question was a large and very well known company that has spent years building a solid reputation through the provision of world leading products. In each case the blogger highlighted problems about the company and its products and suggested any Chinese company using the product was stupid. The articles were duplicated in various forms and distributed through China’s online technology forums . It was our conclusion that the client was undeserving of such an attack and any plan to protect its reputation was justified.Managing Reputation in China – Top TipsFinally, using SEO as an ongoing process to promote both positive PR articles and content from blogs and bulletin boards can be a smart defensive strategy to protect your brand and dominate page one results on Baidu and Google in China.Tags: Baidu, BBS Bulletin Board Systems, China, Google, Google China, Reputation Management, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4240,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/bbs-bulletin-board-systems/','BBS Bulletin Board Systems - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Managing your brand terms on Baidu and Google China Over the past few months, two companies contacted us with online reputation problems in China.

Examples of such links include but are not limited to: search engine result pages, automatically generated pages from webmaster services, and links automatically collected/created by garbage websites.Baidu claims that 98% of such links can be identified by Baidu and will be filtered in backlinks calculation. Under normal circumstances, these links will not cause adverse effect to the target website.Backlink spam:These links are created by the target (benefiting) website either manually or programmatically, with the main purpose of deceiving search engines and interfering with search engine rankings.Examples of such links include, but are not limited to: anchor text spam, paid links, black hat links, bulk increase of low quality backlinks, link wheels, etc.In addition to detecting and filtering these links, Baidu will also process the target website to cause direct negative impact for ownership of such backlink spam.Baidu identified several common backlink spam techniques as negative examples:Anchor text spam: Examples are deceptive anchor texts such as those claiming to be the official website, or a different website with more authority.Backlinks with the sole purpose of increasing authority: Such as links obtained from black hat techniques, paid links, link farm or link wheels.Bulk acquisition of backlinks: Web 2.0 bulk link creation (obvious anchor text insertion, BBS signature, and other obvious machine- generated bulk link building), reciprocal links and link wheels.Cloaking: Website or backlinks engineered to return different content to Baidu spider that are unrelated to content presented to normal users. This is not technically categorized as backlink spam, but it is a severe cheating behaviour and will attract penalty from Baidu.Tags: backlink detection, Baidu, ChinaCategory: China, PPC China, SEO China','article'),(4248,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/backlink-detection/','backlink detection - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Baidu Reveal Questionable Backlink Detection Baidu published an article on 25 April discussing the recent addition of a link disavow tool into its webmaster tool.

The project these two Internet giants are working on at the moment encompasses the development of a search engine specifically made for the extremely popular content curation platform ‘Naver Matome’.This search engine will be deployed in two different ways: within the organic search results of Yahoo! Japan and as the internal search engine on the Naver Matome website itself.Naver Matome – A short OverviewThe Japanese content curation platform was launched in July 2009 and became very popular in the last couple years. In January 2013 it recorded no less than 1.28 billion page views and 41 million unique visitors.Like with any other content curation platform, the main goal is to categorise, organise and present already existing content on the Internet. Each page or ‘Matome’ is about a specific topic or keyword and is accessible to anyone for free as soon as it is published. In order to become a content curator, you simply need to sign up for a free account on Naver Japan. Creating a Matome is then very self-explanatory and uncomplicated as you can see in the screenshot below.Implications for SEO in JapanThe announced Naver Matome vertical results in the Yahoo! Japan’s SERPs might have a big impact on SEO in Japan depending on the implementation. This is especially the case because Matome results will be treated ‘with priority’, probably meaning that they might even appear above paid results.The project is planned to be implemented by the end of April at latest, then we will see how much of a priority Matome results will be given.Tags: Naver, SEO in Japan, Yahoo JapanCategory: Japan, SEO Japan','article'),(4291,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/soso/page/2/','Soso - 2/3 - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Smaller Search Engines Growing Market Share in China As menitioned in my last post, iResearch has confirmed the percentage change in search engine market share in China for Q2 which demonstrates Sogou is gaining market share at the expense of both Google and Baidu in China.

When it comes to web analytics packages, many will choose Google Analytics because it covers the basics, is continuously getting improved upon and best of all, it’s free.By default Google Analytics can recognise organic traffic from major search engines worldwide, and you can check their list of support search engines for details. However, lesser search engines are not supported by default and traffic gets recorded as regular referral instead. As we have seen from China’s search engine market share, it is a good idea to keep a close eye on the lesser search engines, as Google’s second place influence has been in continuous decline ever since their service was re-routed to their Hong Kong site last year, and local operators are no doubt hoping to one day take over.You can tell Google Analytics to track and recognize organic traffic from additional search engines by tweaking the tracking code you use on your sites. This is done through adding a few lines using the addOrganic method. Below we will show how to add support for SOSO, Sogou and Youdao, the three strongest search engines after Baidu and Google, for both the asynchronous tracking code and the synchronous version. You should choose to follow the version that you are currently using, and replace “UA-XXXXXX-X” with your profile ID.Simply add lines 5-7 to your tracking code as demonstrated below for a standard asynchronous setup. Other manual tweaks can be made if necessary.Simply add lines 8-10 to your tracking code as demonstrated below for a standard traditional setup. Once again, other manual tweaks can be made if necessary.Once you have updated the tracking code on your site, Google Analytics will be able to recognize traffic from SOSO, Sogou and Youdao as organic, and include it in search traffic and keyword reports.Tags: Analytics, China, Google, Google Analytics, Google China, Sogou, Soso, YoudaoCategory: Analytics, Analytics China','article'),(4353,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/analytics-china/search-analytics-in-china-baidu-tongji-cnzz-and-google-analytics/attachment/baidu-tongji/','Baidu Tongji','','','Category: ','article'),(4354,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/analytics-china/search-analytics-in-china-baidu-tongji-cnzz-and-google-analytics/attachment/baidu-tongji-2/','Baidu Tongji 2','','','Category: ','article'),(4355,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/analytics-china/search-analytics-in-china-baidu-tongji-cnzz-and-google-analytics/feed','','','','','others'),(4356,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/analytics-china/search-analytics-in-china-baidu-tongji-cnzz-and-google-analytics/attachment/baidu-tongji-3/','Baidu Tongji 3','','','Category: ','article'),(4357,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/analytics-china/google-analytics-tracking-code-for-china-update/trackback/','Google Analytics Tracking Code for China – Update','','Edit your Google Analytics tracking code to add support for Chinese search engines that Google does not include out of the box.','Edited October 5, 2012: Since 360 Search has changed its domain to www.so.com, the GA code below has been updated to adapt to the new referrer string.Last year, we posted about editing your tracking code to make Google Analytics support Chinese search engines.With the addition of Qihoo 360 to the China search engine market, we thought it is time to update the GA tracking code again.The following snippet will add support to Google Analytics for 360 Search, SoSo, Sogou and Youdao.

Now it’s time to talk about Baidu Tongji, a screenshot of which is provided below. When used with Baidu’s other products, including Baidu Index, Baidu Trends, and Baidu Data Center, Baidu Tongji can add a lot of value to webmasters, SEO practitioners and managers.Baidu Indexation checkThough we can use the command site:www.example.com to find out the number of pages indexed by Baidu, the number is not accurate. Furthermore, the “site” command doesn’t work with sub-directories; for example when you search site:www.example.com/abc on Baidu, it provides you with the feedback “wrong command”. But by installing Baidu Tongji, webmasters can easily find out the exact indexation numbers for the domain, sub-domains or subdirectories by clicking on the button as indicated below.Keyword Suggestions and Search VolumeWhen integrated with Baidu Index, Baidu Tongji provides keyword search volumes and keyword suggestions on the same interface along with keyword search performance. This gives webmasters and SEO’s a clear direction if there is still room for the keyword landing page to improve, and what other keywords they can create content and optimize for.Conversion AnalysisThe major advantage Baidu Tonji has over CNZZ is that it adds Conversions as a metric, and makes it much more advanced than purely a Statistics Tool, by providing webmasters with an insight beyond Traffic and Page Views.But only one tab, called Conversion Path, under the section called Web Analysis on Baidu Tongji reports conversions. This is nothing compared with Google Analytics, as GA gives Target (Conversions) the same importance as visitors, traffic sources and content, and under its Target (Conversions) section there are 7 tabs analyzing different metrics. Understanding conversions is crucial for many sites including, in particular, eCommerce sites. Without enhanced segmented conversion metrics, I do not believe at this stage Baidu Tongji will be widely utilized eCommerce site owners. However, no doubt Baidu still has plans to continually improve on Baidu Tongji.Some advantages of Baidu Tongji over GA for the China Market Despite some of the shortfalls Baidu Tongji has when compared with GA, there are still many positives which do have certain advantages over GA.For example, Baidu Tongji does provide very detailed information on the segmentation of Chinese localization and allows you to choose to segment your website’s visits by province or area within China, thereby enabling you to analyze visits coming from different regions within China.Furthermore, Baidu Tongji offers useful databases including information on the IP base for Chinese cities and statistics based on the most used browsers or ISPs in China.Finally, Baidu Tongji provides more information than GA on a micro scale of website visitors’ activities including information on the last 500 visitor records and detailed visitor tracks throughout your website for individual visitors which is an interesting and useful analytics feature for SEO managers dealing with the China market.Tags: Analytics, Baidu, Baidu Tongji, China, CNZZCategory: Analytics, Analytics China','article'),(4366,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/Kun%20Tang/feed/','','','','','others'),(4369,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/munyin/feed/','','','','','others'),(4370,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/kun-tang/page/3/','Kun Tang - 3/3 - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' An Introduction to CNZZ Web Analytics in China About a month ago Alibaba bought CNZZ and brought this China grass root web analytics tool to the attention of the public.

With significantly increasing numbers of users, comments about Meilishuo.com are also growing rapidly on various industry websites. Some commentaries have said meilishuo.com and mogujie.com have created a precedent for community-based e-commerce in China. So, what does meilishuo.com look like?IntroductionMeilishuo.com was founded in November 2009, specializing in women’s fashion. It helps middle class women to find the ideal clothing and skin care products which are best suited to them. Users can search for experts, shops, group buying, and they can also share online shopping links and information on their favorite products. The products listed on Meilishuo.com come from third party websites, and primarily have listings on Taobao, China’s largest e-commerce site. When users click on a product on Meilishuo, they are re-directed to the third party sites, including Taobao, where they can make their purchase and after which Meilishuo will receive a commission.Current StateAccording to Meilishuo.com, the number of registered users has reached 150 million since its launch in March 2010. The daily user volume is 3.2 million while the daily number of page views is 164 million, and per user traffic is averaged at 51 pages. Every month, the website brings about 700 million yuan to Taobao’s turnover.The following chart provides a screen shot of the Alexa open data platform which has analyzed meilishuo.com. The chart shows the daily traffic rank trend of meilishuo.com, which shows a significant upward trend.Profit ModelsMeilishuo.com is a social e-commerce sharing model. In this vertical field, people who have the same interests and hobbies (i.e. finding out about the latest in fashion and shopping for clothes) come together to recommend, share and comment on the many different products which are available. As mentioned above, these products come from third party websites. If people visit meilishuo.com and then buy products on the third party websites like Taobao, meilishuo.com will get a commission. In simple terms, meilishuo.com is a shopping guide entrance – letting people know what the latest fashion trends are /what to buy/ how to mix and match etc.. It does this through good design and layout, which helps to stimulate user interest in buying, and then lead them to Taobao. Meilishuo.com claim their orientation is social e-commerce and their main profits come from advertisements. In addition, group buying also brings significant profits.I think the shortcomings of meilishuo.com are that the product styles are limited to those offered on Taobao, and that the site can even be said to be overly dependent on Taobao. Secondly, it’s difficult to control how Taobao sellers’ self-promote their products on the site. This will bring bad user experiences if the Taobao listings are not up to standard.Promotion modelsFor most of its website promotion, meilishuo.com uses various means to promote online including a huge investment in advertising; traditional search engine optimization strategies; social media platforms (especially Weibo); QQ interconnections and so on. At the same time meilishuo.com has also pursued Mobile App’s to promote on the mobile internet. Now users can enter the site via IPAD / IPHONE and ANDORID ports as well.Meilishuo.com is also focusing on co-operation with QQ interconnection as mentioned above. QQ interconnection is a new function of Tencent, which is similar to Weibo interconnection. Website owners can apply to have the “QQ interconnection” login placed on their sites, so that when users visit their sites, they can use their QQ account to login to the website (with no need to create a new account) which is beneficial for the website owner who can know more about their users. So if users access Meilishuo through QQ interconnection, when they find a good dress, they can click “share”- and then the dress information will be posted on their QQ-zone (which means their QQ blog). “Like” functions are also available through QQ interconnection.When comparing the traffic from QQ interconnection and search engines, iResearch found that the relationship between the two is one to one. After accessing QQ interconnection, the total traffic and number of users of meilishuo.com increased 20% and 70%. In other words, utilizing QQ interconnection for attracting traffic is a win-win promotion method to both Meilishuo and Tencent.Tags: China, E-Commerce, Meilishuo.com, Social MediaCategory: E-commerce, E-commerce China, SEO, SEO China, Social, Social Media China','article'),(4379,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/e-commerce-china/meilishuo-com-a-popular-social-shopping-website/feed','','','','','others'),(4381,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/Monique%20Li/feed/','','','','','others'),(4382,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/monique-li/page/2/','Monique Li - 2/2 - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Diandian Light blogging offsite link building in China Since Diandian launched its light blogging platform in April, its user groups are growing rapidly.

Japan seems to have been completed. The image below depicts a particular search term with the Google results on the left and Yahoo! Japan results on the right hand side. Japanese SEO’s will be interested to note that the results on both sites show a perfect match.As further confirmation that the integration may now be complete, Yahoo used to show “Search Results provided by Yahoo! Inc.” in the footer of its search result listings, however that has now been removed as can be seen from the below listings.BEFORE:AFTER:Even though the above results do show a perfect match, Yahoo has previously stated they will customize their search results to meet individual user preferences and such search results would be different from those presented by Google. Perhaps they were referring to the shopping section of their search results. For example, if you search for “Digital Camera” in both Google and Yahoo!, for Google they will have Google Shopping listed in their search results and for Yahoo!, Yahoo! Auctions will be displayed. Even though the integration seems to be complete, neither Google nor Yahoo! Japan have confirmed this.Implications for SEO in JapanThe result of the integration is that Google now has more than 90% of the search market in Japan, and for natural search results on Yahoo! Japan, the results generated will be powered by Google. Therefore, Japanese SEO has become a lot easier in that you only really need to do optimization for Google’s search algorithm. On the flip-side, make sure you use legitimate SEO methods as any penalty on Google in Japan will cost you dearly in ranking performance, as Yahoo! Japan is no longer the dominant search results provider.Tags: Google, Google Japan, Japan, SEO, Yahoo JapanCategory: SEO, SEO Japan','article'),(4399,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/ppc-japan/japanese-sem-ppc-in-japan/attachment/yahoo-japan-listing-ads-ppc/','Yahoo Japan Listing Ads PPC','','','Category: ','article'),(4400,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/ppc-japan/japanese-sem-ppc-in-japan/attachment/yahoo-japan-listing-ads/','Yahoo Japan Listing Ads','','','Category: ','article'),(4401,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/ppc-japan/japanese-sem-ppc-in-japan/attachment/yahoo-japan-listing-ads-interest-match/','Yahoo Japan Listing Ads Interest Match','','','Category: ','article'),(4402,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/Hiroshi%20Oyo/','Hiroshi Oyo - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' 5 SEO Strategies to enhance your E-commerce web site Everyone who has an idea always wants to sell their product online to reach the largest possible audience.

Japan Partnership','','This article examines the Yahoo Japan / Google partnership and the implications for Japanese SEO practitioners...','It has been over 3 months since Yahoo Japan announced that they will adopt Google’s search engine technology. Yahoo Japan has said it hopes to fully integrate Google’s search technology by the end of the year which will have a major impact for Japanese SEO and search engine marketers in Japan.Microsoft is opposed to the alliance in Japan and is currently in talks regarding this opposition with Japan’s Fair Trade Commission (“FTC”). Additionally, Japan’s largest online retailer, Rakuten, has just launched a petition with the FTC also opposing the alliance and has requested the FTC to review the original decision to allow it to go ahead. Assuming the deal does go ahead as planned, here are the relevant facts from an SEO perspective.The Yahoo Japan and Google partnership involves the integration into Yahoo Japan’s search platform of Google’s Web, Images, and Video Search Technologies, as well as its Mobile and Pay for Performance Technologies. Also, as Yahoo Japan announced, although they will be adopting Google’s search and advertising technology, they will customize their search results to Yahoo users and people will continue to experience a difference when searching on Yahoo compared with Google.The integration of Google’s search technology into Yahoo Japan’s portal is currently under testing with certain specified users being granted special access to the new system for testing purposes. One such privileged person is Kenichi Suzuki, an SEO specialist in Japan, who has published the following results on his blog for the generic search term “Overseas Travel”. (Image from (Kenichi Suzuki’s Blog) :The results in Fig 1 demonstrate a 100% match appearing on both Google and Yahoo Japan for the search term “Overseas Travel”.However, as Yahoo Japan has specified, they will still be intending to present results in a customized way to their users which will be different from Google’s. As the integration will be only for those 5 sections mentioned above, the integration therefore will not include maps or other localized search functions.Therefore, I believe that searches for brand keywords may well show different search results as the different localization functionalities take effect. No exact measurement of the differences can be calculated at this moment as the integration is only open to specified users as mentioned above. Below is another example from (Kenichi Suzuki’s Blog) where localized searches for a particular term continue to show their own different results on Yahoo Japan and on Google:The results for generic searches appear to be the same and those for local searches appear, at this stage at least, to be a little different. We can’t speculate about how much customization will occur as Yahoo Japan has announced will be the case, however overall I would say that the above results may well be very good for many multinational companies engaging in Japanese SEO as it would appear at this stage at least that they will be able to adopt similar optimization strategies for their websites in Japan to be deployed across both Yahoo Japan and Google.Of course, if the challenges to the alliance now coming from both Microsoft and Rakuten, about which I shall discuss in my next blog post, come to any fruition and the deal is ultimately blocked then the above conclusions may well turn out to be ineffectual. We shall have to wait and see!UPDATE- 2 Dec, 2010: The FTC has now dismissed any objections to the partnership and has now formally approved it.

The FTC has now commenced an investigation and is interviewing the various parties concerned. The next infographic depicts the overall scope of the current situation as will be described in further detail below.Microsoft Concerns:The biggest concern from Microsoft is the market share in Japan. Having Yahoo Japan and Google partnering, they will be securing 90% of search business in Japan. This will strike a critical blow for them, having launched Bing back in June, a month before Yahoo Japan and Google announced its partnership.(Data taken from Nielson Online（JPN:ネットレイティングス） May 27th 2010)Rakuten’s ConcernsRakuten’s concerns are different and would appear to be more complex. They are obviously concerned about potential adverse impacts upon their business, which, being the largest online retailer in Japan, is heavily dependent upon search engines for gaining new visitors and purchasers on their site.What they seem to be saying is that the Yahoo Japan/Google tie up, resulting in a combined 90% search market share in Japan for search, could adversely impact their search results in the two search engines, and as they have further said, could potentially hinder growth of internet companies in general in Japan.Specifically, Rakuten’s Executive Officer Satoshi Seki says there is no guarantee that the two can remain independent and that it will be difficult to monitor the consequences on search results unless web search operators make more disclosure on the criteria they use for displaying such results. Juro Osawa Dow Jones Newswires 25/10/2010Conclusion:Expect strong opposition to the Yahoo Japan / Google partnership from Microsoft but especially from Rakuten, whose business could be significantly challenged at home if the FTC does ultimately allow the partnership to proceed as originally approved.Furthermore, Yahoo Japan chose Google as its partner rather than Bing because Google’s Japanese Language search capabilities were better than Bing’s in their opinion.Also partnering with Bing would only secure 60% of the market share in Japan (compared with 90% with Google) but with a corresponding decrease in the quality of services. Instead, choosing to work with Google will not only secure their own market share, but will maintain their quality services.UPDATE- 2 Dec, 2010: The FTC has now dismissed any objections to the partnership and has now formally approved it.

Considering that Naver leads the Korean search engine market with a share of more than 70%, this announcement could cause a lot of turmoil in the Korean SEO industry.On November 26th, NHN Corp. released a press statement announcing the introduction of the new search algorithm ‘Libra’. The aim of the change is to push down over-optimised results in the search engine result pages and give way to more quality content on the upper positions. The implementation will be conducted gradually, starting with the most popular keywords and, for now, only within the blog section of the Naver search results.Considering the fact that 84% of all social media users in Korea are either reading or keeping a blog, this algorithm change is going to have a big impact on the blogging scene and the search engine optimization industry as well, as blogs are an integral part of the natural search results on Naver.The main goal of the algorithm is to distinguish trustworthy, original content from over-optimised, less credible postings. Trustworthy content is determined by factors such as the number of clicks or the age and activity rate of the blog. For now, Naver only reveals these little hints in order to prevent new black hat activities, which is the reason for introducing this new algorithm in the first place.Changes are going to affect the rankings of more than 300 million existing blog posts and several tens of thousands new blog post every day. The implementation will happen gradually, starting with popular search terms, such as “good restaurants in …“, and is going to be expanded over time.I know at first hand that these changes are being considered as very severe within the Korean SEO community. Naver will give out guidelines together with the release of the algorithm at the beginning of December on how to adapt to the new rules and changes. Stay tuned and we will keep you updated on the new Naver guidelines and the changes in the Korean search engine market.Tags: Naver, Naver Blog, SEO in KoreaCategory: SEO, SEO Korea, Social, Social Media Korea','article'),(4440,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/seo-korea/new-naver-libra-algorithm-update-changes-korean-seo-playing-field/feed','','','','','others'),(4444,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/social-media-korea/seo-korea-new-social-network-search-functions-on-naver-daum-in-korea/attachment/daum-2/','Daum','','','Category: ','article'),(4445,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/social-media-korea/seo-korea-new-social-network-search-functions-on-naver-daum-in-korea/attachment/naver-7/','naver','','','Category: ','article'),(4446,'http://www.searchblog.asia/useful-programs-for-social-media-marketing-in-korea','Useful programs for Social Media Marketing in Korea','','A discussion of Korean Social Media programs designed to synchronize posts on the two most popular Social Networking sites in Korea - Me2Day, Twitter','In my last post I spoke from a Korean SEO perspective about the booming use of Social Networking Services in Korea with the two main platforms currently in use being Me2Day (which is owned by Naver – Korea’s biggest search engine) and Twitter.With rapidly increasing numbers of people using these services, new programs are naturally being developed to synchronize tweets or Me2Day posts with each other and/or with the Naver blog which Naver runs separately from Me2Day. These programs enable you to post something on any platform out of the three options (Twitter, Me2Day, Naver blog), and then your post will automatically be delivered to one or more of the other platforms. Such programs are a useful tool for social media marketing and more broadly disseminating your company’s message.The first program to discuss, since Me2Day and the Naver blog are run by the same company, NHN Corp., is the program on Naver that links posts on Me2Day and the Naver blog to each other. You can easily set your settings on both platforms and your post on the Naver blog will appear at the same time you upload it on Me2Day and vice versa. If you use this program, a lot of time and energy can be saved since you need not post the same thing twice.Second is a program called Me2Day to Twitter that can be found at http://me2twit.kkung.net/. In order to use this program, you must have an account for both Twitter and Me2Day. One thing to be aware of is that this program only sends Me2Day posts to Twitter and not the other way around and attached links and linked images sometimes get omitted in the delivery process. So at this stage it is not entirely reliable, but still useful.In any event, these programs can be very useful especially if you are trying to promote your business or do social media marketing in Korea.In summary, the Korean social media landscape is dynamic and social media marketing using the abovementioned most popular micro-blogs and programs in Korea can certainly prove to be a worthwhile exercise in engaging your target audience and disseminating the message of your brand.Tags: Korea, Me2Day, Naver Blog, Social Media, TwitterCategory: Social, Social Media Korea','article'),(4447,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/social-media-korea/seo-korea-new-social-network-search-functions-on-naver-daum-in-korea/attachment/daum/','Daum','','','Category: ','article'),(4448,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/social-media-korea/seo-korea-new-social-network-search-functions-on-naver-daum-in-korea/trackback/','SEO Korea – New Social Network Search Functions on Naver & Daum in Korea','','A comparison of the new Social Search functions on Korea\'s Major Search Engines, Naver and Daum, and the implications for SEO in Korea.','Services on Korean search engines constantly move forward as user trends change. As a consequence Korean SEO is also constantly evolving. One of the most noticeable trends in the internet market in Korea is the increasing use of social networking services and the number of their users. In order to adapt quickly to these new trends, Naver and Daum, the most influential search engines in Korea, have both launched new services which show search results based on users social networking connections. For both of these services, searches are based on the account holder’s social connections within Naver and Daum. These new services are useful in that the results are personalized and customized since they only sort information from users’ own online connections. Naturally, as users continue to make more connections, more results will be displayed in the tailored search results of these new services. Now, let me introduce you to these new services in detail.Naver- ‘Social Network’Naver’s new search platform is called ‘Social Network’ and it was launched in October 2010. ‘Social Network’ results can only be found if you are logged into your Naver account as it uses your social network connections on your personal account to search for results. Network connections include your blog ‘neighbors’, members of cafés that you’re registered to and Me2Day friends. ‘Social Network’ search is more convenient and provides a differentiated service compared to the regular combined search. For example, the results shown in the ‘Social Network’ category may seem more useful and reliable to the user since the provider of the information is someone you know or share interests with. In order to view the results on the ‘Social Network’ more easily, you can change the settings so that you can combine or separate the results from blogs, cafés, and/or microblogs.Daum- ‘My Social’Daum’s new search platform is called ‘My Social’ and it was launched in December 2010. Similar to that of Naver, it basically is another search category that only shows results based on your social networking connections. These connections may be cafes you’re registered to, your blog and other blogs you’re neighbors with, your ‘view’ and other ‘view’ you’ve subscribed to and posts you’ve written on ‘Agora’. The results can be viewed on the combined search results page or also under the ‘My Social’ tab. Of course, you must be logged into your account if you wish to see any results listed under ‘My Social’.Naver’s ‘Social Network’ VS. Daum’s ‘My Social’/Comparison between the two servicesOne of the good things about any result within ‘Social Network’ or ‘My Social’ is that the information may be very trustworthy since the source of the information is from someone you know, either on-line or off-line. So, with the launch of these services, users can find useful information more easily and quickly. To make better use of these new features on Naver and Daum, users will no doubt keep building connections so that they can get a more comprehensive set of results. From an SEO Korea perspective, companies wishing to broaden their exposure in the Korean search market should be looking to increase the volume of their content on social networking services like cafés, blogs and Me2Day to cover as many search categories as possible for the products or services they wish to promote. Then when users of these new social search platforms on Naver and Daum conduct searches, there will be more opportunities for such products or services to be found.

These two platforms are similar yet very different in terms of their user bases and membership participation levels with such differences being relevant for marketers in Korea. Let me start by introducing, from a Korean perspective, the two different social networking service platforms or micro-blogging platforms most commonly used in Korea; Twitter and Me2Day.Twitter Twitter started to become popular in Korea after the South Korean election in 2008 when it was used by candidates to get their message out and by voters to make their own commentary on the elections. The most active Twitter users in Korea now include many celebrities, ‘chae-bol’ (Korean conglomerates) executives, writers, athletes and social figures. Like in the west their presence on Twitter has resulted in them becoming very influential, with many of their followers and fans joining Twitter, too. Me2DayMe2Day is a Korean social networking/micro-blogging platform started in 2007 and is run by NHN Corp. which also runs Naver, Korea’s biggest search engine. Unlike Twitter, which limits posts to no more than 140 characters, the posts on Me2Day can be as long as users want. Me2Day adopts a more managed approach to promoting itself unlike twitter which is more organic. Me2Day holds Q&A sessions with famous athletes and entertainers and recently held a Q&A event with Korean football legend Cha Bum-Keun, a.k.a. Cha Bum, during the World Cup period and a previous MLB player Bong Jung-Keun while he participated in the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games.Comparison of Twitter and Me2dayOne important initial distinction between the two different platforms for Korean SEO and Social Media specialists to note is that Me2Day is only available for use within Korea whereas Twitter has a global user base. In terms of popularity and awareness, while Twitter of course is very well known because of its global platform and high profile “Tweeters”, Me2Day actually has a substantially higher number of users across all age groups. For marketers trying to create awareness about their products or services with Korean citizens Me2Day should be the initial go-to platform. This is demonstrated by the below two tables comparing user volumes and age-groups across the two platforms.Key Points to note:Tags: Korea, Me2Day, Social Media, TwitterCategory: Social, Social Media Korea','article'),(4452,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/social-media-korea/seo-korea-useful-programs-for-social-media-marketing-in-korea/attachment/me2day-8/','me2day','','','Category: ','article'),(4453,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/social-media-korea/seo-korea-useful-programs-for-social-media-marketing-in-korea/attachment/naver-5/','naver','','','Category: ','article'),(4454,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/social-media-korea/seo-korea-useful-programs-for-social-media-marketing-in-korea/attachment/small_twitter-logo-2/','twitter','','','Category: ','article'),(4455,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/social-media-korea/seo-korea-booming-social-networking-services-in-korea/attachment/small_twitter-logo/','small_twitter-logo','','','Category: ','article'),(4456,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/social-media-korea/seo-korea-booming-social-networking-services-in-korea/attachment/me2day-3/','me2day','','','Category: ','article'),(4457,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/social-media-korea/seo-korea-booming-social-networking-services-in-korea/attachment/social-networking-in-korea/','Social Networking in Korea','','','Category: ','article'),(4458,'http://www.searchblog.asia/thailand/e-commerce-thailand/thai-businesses-go-online-with-google-thailand-online-shopping-feature/attachment/thai-business-online-shopping-google-thailand/','Thai Business Online Shopping – Google Thailand','','','Category: ','article'),(4459,'http://www.searchblog.asia/thailand/e-commerce-thailand/thai-businesses-go-online-with-google-thailand-online-shopping-feature/attachment/thai-business-online-shopping-google-thailand-1-2/','Thai Business Online Shopping – Google Thailand – 1','','','Category: ','article'),(4460,'http://www.searchblog.asia/thailand/e-commerce-thailand/thailand-e-commerce-trends-in-2011/attachment/thailand-e-commerce-graph-1/','Thailand E Commerce Trends in 2011','','','Category: ','article'),(4461,'http://www.searchblog.asia/thailand/e-commerce-thailand/thailand-e-commerce-trends-in-2011/attachment/thailand-e-commerce-graph-2/','Thailand E Commerce Trends for 2011','','','Category: ','article'),(4462,'http://www.searchblog.asia/thailand/e-commerce-thailand/thailand-e-commerce-trends-in-2011/trackback/','Thailand E-Commerce Trends in 2011','','An analysis of the rapidly increasing use of E-commerce in Thailand for 2011 including the reasons for the increases and where the money is being spent.','This year (2011) Thailand e-commerce is growing very fast with the behavior of Thai users changing rapidly. Statistics from NECTEC show that the percentage of Thai users shopping online has risen from 47.8% in 2010 to 57.2% in 2011 which is already a 9.4% increase from the previous year.These statistics confirm that Thai users are becoming more familiar with online-shopping and many companies are starting to use online business strategies to attract more customers.The factors driving the increase in Thailand e-commerce1. Online payment system developmentIn the past, Thailand e-commerce companies just had credit cards to support online payments however credit cards in Thailand have not in the past been that popular.Now more payment systems are developing and users have many choices to make an online payment such as using credit cards, debit cards or online payment service companies.All of the Thai banks give priority to online payments, and have developed systems that can accept debit cards or allow internet banking to make an online payment. The money will directly be deducted from user accounts after products have been purchased.Online Payment Service Companies are another choice for users that don’t have credit cards. There are currently 3 companies in Thailand providing these services including Paysbuy, PayPal and TARADpay.Moreover, Thailand also has MPay and True Money services to support users that would like to make a payment via mobile. Users are obviously finding it more convenient to shop and make payments online.2. Ease of creation of e-commerce websitesA lot of companies in Thailand provide instant e-commerce websites where you can create a new online shop with in 24 hours. It’s easy to create by just following the instructions. This in turn has enabled the number of online shops to increase substantially each year.Additionally, last year big shopping malls in Thailand including Central, The Mall, Big C, and Lotus began to start online shopping campaigns to increase sales volumes which has provided users with more choices to select products they want.3. E-commerce shops always have promotionsE-commerce shops have a lot of competitors so most online shops try to attract customers by offering lower product prices or conducting special promotions. This is another reason that the number online shoppers in Thailand is increasing.4. Group buying Trends In Thailand Group buying trends on social e-commerce is also increasing. The price of products will decrease when buyers join together to buy the product with the greater the number of buyers, the lower the price. Therefore most buyers will spread the news about such promotions via social networks like Facebook. Such a strategy can attract more users to buy products on the internet.The Top 5 Thailand E-commerce websites as ranked by truehits.net ref:http://shopping.truehits.net/ are:1.

ThaiOnlineMarket.comURL: http://www.thaionlinemarket.com/Popular products on Thailand e-commerce sitesFrom the Thai internet user survey in 2010, Books are the most popular products that Thai user order from internet which represents 34.7% of online sales with the next being reservation services online at 31.3% and 26.7% for buying clothes. And the percentage of orders for cosmetics, electrical appliances and toys is also increasing.I believe that the trend of using e-commerce in Thailand will continue to grow in 2011 and beyond. Therefore if your business has not yet joined an e-commerce site or set one up of its own, now is the right time to do so.Tags: E-Commerce, Market Research, PantipMarket, Pramool, Tarad, Thailand, ThaiOnlineMarket, WeLoveShoppingCategory: E-commerce, E-commerce Thailand','article'),(4463,'http://www.searchblog.asia/thailand/e-commerce-thailand/thailand-e-commerce-trends-in-2011/feed','','','','','others'),(4468,'http://www.searchblog.asia/seo-thailand-the-time-is-right-for-seo-in-thailand','The time is right for SEO in Thailand','','Thailand is a rapidly growing market and SEO Thailand is still developing. This blog profiles the Thai search market and examines the benefits of SEO in Thailand...','For companies already doing business in Thailand or planning to expand into the Thailand market, now could be the right time to commence your SEO Thailand program for this rapidly growing market.Thailand is one of the fastest growing internet markets in Asia and for that matter the world. The statistics below show that the number of Internet users in Thailand has been rapidly increasing every year from about 1998 onwards. The internet usage penetration in Thailand has also increased dramatically each year as can be seen from the graph below which indicates an increase in user rates from only 3.7% of the population in the year 2000 to an impressive 26.3% as at 2010.These statistics clearly demonstrate a rapidly growing internet market in Thailand which represents a good opportunity for companies to start thinking about and implementing Thailand SEO strategies.*Population in Thailand from Ministry of Interior (Thailand) Changing technology and rising income levels are playing a big part in the rapid growth of the internet in Thailand. As can be seen from the graph below, Thailand’s average monthly income has been on a steady rise over the past 10 years which also corresponds to the increasing internet usage rates demonstrated above:-In Thailand with affordable new technologies users can connect to the internet in multiple ways: including from broadband or mobile internet. There are various other factors in addition to those just mentioned that are attracting more users of the internet in Thailand: 1. With the advent of smart phone technology that can support mobile internet connectivity; it’s easier to connect to the internet from many areas in Thailand, more cheaply than using PC’s.2. Smart Mobile devices offer lots of widgets/gadgets and applications that further promote pervasive use of the internet3. Application of social networks such as games, news, research & online shopping that attract a wider demograph of users.In addition to the above Thai users are increasingly using search engines for research and other search related activities as can be seen from the below statistics showing the increasing usage of search engines in Thailand from 2007-2009The strategy to optimize your website in Thailand is not as difficult to do when compared with other countries in Asia because Thailand has no local search engines like Baidu in China or Naver in Korea. Google is only major search engine in Thailand with over 90% market share as the below statistics show. Therefore Thailand SEO strategies need to be implemented for Google only. Moreover, overall optimization efforts in Thailand are currently lower when compared with western markets which is another reason that implementing successful SEO strategies in Thailand is not as difficult as other more developed markets.The internet in Thailand is becoming more reliable and convenient to connect to using both broadband and mobile internet products. The Thai economy continues to grow and disposable incomes for Thai people are on the rise. Users are turning to search engines and social media sites to keep updated with trends and news and also for shopping. These factors combined with the overall low level of competition in SEO in Thailand means any early investment in SEO by a company can pay off significantly.

If “Content is King”, then surely “Backlinks are Queen”. In terms of backlinking strategies, we also know that quality links coming from within a local market or country are potentially more valuable for SEO than having the same quality links coming in from another country.A common method used by many SEO’s to get backlinks is through directory and article submissions. In Thailand however, it is quite difficult to find good quality local directory and article submission sites. Even if you can find directory submission sites, my experience as an SEO Thailand practioner is there is a long waiting time before your website gets posted on them. Furthermore, many of the more well known article submission sites are not based in Thailand and often don’t accept articles in Thai language, particularly if your website has been localized and the default language is in Thai. In fact, it can be quite difficult to do quality link building in Thailand.The Alternative of Social BookmarkingIf you have also experienced such difficulties as mentioned above or are wishing to commence a Thailand SEO strategy, then one attractive alternative which has worked well for me and has produced results quickly is to use Thai social bookmarking services to get backlinks. Such a strategy can still be done in parallel with your article and directory submission efforts, if you still wish to pursue those.Social bookmarking is a fast method which helps you increase traffic and backlinks at the same time. You also can get page rank (PR) from social bookmarking websites if you choose those with Dofollow settings. Moreover, social bookmarking can help achieve greater indexation from robots in a shorter period.The ResultsThe graph below shows the ranking improvement results I was able to achieve recently for one of my clients’ Thai websites through the use of social bookmarking.To achieve these results, I submitted their chosen Thai keywords to various Thai social bookmarking sites everyday for 4 weeks, with the rankings for every keyword rising substantially during the same period, as is shown in the graph.The results are impressive and clearly demonstrate that social bookmarking services can have a positive impact on rankings. If you are looking to do SEO in Thailand then I strongly recommend you consider employing such a strategy.Tags: Content Writing, Google Thailand, Link Building, Onsite Optimization, SEO, Social Bookmarking, ThailandCategory: SEO, SEO Thailand','article'),(4473,'http://www.searchblog.asia/thailand/seo-thailand/seo-thailand-how-to-get-quality-local-backlinks-in-thailand/feed','','','','','others'),(4478,'http://www.searchblog.asia/thailand/seo-thailand/seo-thailand-the-time-is-right-for-seo-in-thailand/trackback/','The time is right for SEO in Thailand','','Thailand is a rapidly growing market and SEO Thailand is still developing. This blog profiles the Thai search market and examines the benefits of SEO in Thailand...','For companies already doing business in Thailand or planning to expand into the Thailand market, now could be the right time to commence your SEO Thailand program for this rapidly growing market.Thailand is one of the fastest growing internet markets in Asia and for that matter the world. The statistics below show that the number of Internet users in Thailand has been rapidly increasing every year from about 1998 onwards. The internet usage penetration in Thailand has also increased dramatically each year as can be seen from the graph below which indicates an increase in user rates from only 3.7% of the population in the year 2000 to an impressive 26.3% as at 2010.These statistics clearly demonstrate a rapidly growing internet market in Thailand which represents a good opportunity for companies to start thinking about and implementing Thailand SEO strategies.*Population in Thailand from Ministry of Interior (Thailand) Changing technology and rising income levels are playing a big part in the rapid growth of the internet in Thailand. As can be seen from the graph below, Thailand’s average monthly income has been on a steady rise over the past 10 years which also corresponds to the increasing internet usage rates demonstrated above:-In Thailand with affordable new technologies users can connect to the internet in multiple ways: including from broadband or mobile internet. There are various other factors in addition to those just mentioned that are attracting more users of the internet in Thailand: 1. With the advent of smart phone technology that can support mobile internet connectivity; it’s easier to connect to the internet from many areas in Thailand, more cheaply than using PC’s.2. Smart Mobile devices offer lots of widgets/gadgets and applications that further promote pervasive use of the internet3. Application of social networks such as games, news, research & online shopping that attract a wider demograph of users.In addition to the above Thai users are increasingly using search engines for research and other search related activities as can be seen from the below statistics showing the increasing usage of search engines in Thailand from 2007-2009The strategy to optimize your website in Thailand is not as difficult to do when compared with other countries in Asia because Thailand has no local search engines like Baidu in China or Naver in Korea. Google is only major search engine in Thailand with over 90% market share as the below statistics show. Therefore Thailand SEO strategies need to be implemented for Google only. Moreover, overall optimization efforts in Thailand are currently lower when compared with western markets which is another reason that implementing successful SEO strategies in Thailand is not as difficult as other more developed markets.The internet in Thailand is becoming more reliable and convenient to connect to using both broadband and mobile internet products. The Thai economy continues to grow and disposable incomes for Thai people are on the rise. Users are turning to search engines and social media sites to keep updated with trends and news and also for shopping. These factors combined with the overall low level of competition in SEO in Thailand means any early investment in SEO by a company can pay off significantly.

If the sites are distributed over CDN and are set up to be multiple hostnames that serve the same exact content (that is, to create a duplicate content issue), it’s strongly recommended to implement rel=”canonical” or another canonicalization technique to avoid the duplicate content problem.One of the signals the search engines use to geotarget websites is the IP address. If the sites are distributed over a very large, global CDN, the sites might associate with many IPs over different regions and search engines may associate the website with an incorrect geographic region based on the IP address. For Google, the solution to such a situation is to set the correct geotargeting by using Google Webmaster Tools.In accordance with Baidu’s Search Engine Guidelines, when discussing if the CDN will affect indexation, Baidu says that the way Baiduspider crawls sites is just like a user visiting the websites. Once visitors can access the site content, Baiduspider can crawl that content as well.When properly designed and implemented, a CDN can improve access to the data it caches by increasing access bandwidth and redundancy and reducing access latency. For search engines such as Google, one of the signals the algorithms use to determine crawl rate is the server response as perceived by search engine bots. To distribute the site content over CDN properly not only improves the user experience but also makes the website more search engine friendly. All in all, we can say that the impact from using CDN on SEO is positive, so if you are now considering using CDN to distribute your content, just go ahead.Tags: Baidu, Baidu Spider, content delivery networks, Geotargeting, Google, International, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Global','article'),(4494,'http://www.searchblog.asia/global/seo-global/will-using-content-delivery-networks-affect-seo/feed','','','','','others'),(4497,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/Felix%20Cen/feed/','','','','','others'),(4498,'http://www.searchblog.asia/global/seo-global/exploring-search-engine-friendly-practice-in-html5-part-2/attachment/html5-logo-1-5/','html5 logo 1','','','Category: ','article'),(4499,'http://www.searchblog.asia/exploring-search-engine-friendly-practice-in-html5','Exploring search engine friendly practice in HTML5','','A description of how to use HTML5 for best search engine friendly practice from our China SEO specialist Daniel Cai...','HTML5 is the latest specification for HTML, and most web browsers with the latest version now have no problems supporting HTML5. When some companies now re-do their website, they tend to upgrade to HTML5. HTML5 is becoming more and more popular, as the programmers feel that the old W3C HTML standard does not cater to their real world development needs. In HTML5, there are a lot of new attributes and tags which can be used for SEO as well. I will use couple of blog posts to share The Egg’s SEO standards in HTML5.1. Javascript must be placed in external files, the code must be placed before </head> or </body>.2. CSS must be placed in external files, and the code must be placed before </head> as well as before the JavaScript code.3. Do not use these elements: applet、basefont、center、dir、font、isindex、menu、s、strike、u、xmp.4. Follow xhtml 1.0 standard：1) Use lower case for tag name in all elements.2) There must be a value assigned for tag property, for example:<input checked=”checked”><input readonly=”readonly”><input disabled=”disabled”><option selected=”selected”>3) All the elements should be closed (special attention to p and li)；5. Elements such as meta, link, br, img, input should be closed with a slash at the end (e.g. <br />).All the form elements (such as input、select、textarea, except for button) must define name property.6. Page structure should not rely on Javescript. With Javascript forbidden, the page still be can be displayed normally, for example, user still can see the second level navigations.7. Must claim the DOCTYPE at the top of the page. Page must have html, head and body element. Title element must be included in <head> element. Below is a sample structure of standard HTML5 page<!dotype html><html lang=”zh-ch”><head><meta charset=”utf-8”><title>Page Title</title><link rel=”stylesheet” href=””><script src=””></script></head><body></body></html>In the next article, we will share more practices in HTML5.Tags: HTML5, International, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Global','article'),(4500,'http://www.searchblog.asia/global/seo-global/exploring-search-engine-friendly-practice-in-html5-part-2/trackback/','Exploring search engine friendly practice in HTML5 – Part 2','','Part 2 of SEO Expert Daniel Cai\'s series on the best practice in coding using HTML5 for SEO.','As I mentioned in my earlier post, HTML is the latest specification for HTML and in HTML5 there are a lot of new attributes and tags which can be used for SEO. In this article, I will keep discussing how to code in a search engine friendly way in HTML5.1. Use new HTML5 elements instead of generic <div id=””> in defining overall structure:1) <header> is a group of introductory/navigation which is different from <head>. <header> may be used directly under the body, or inside an individual article/section.2) <footer>may contain author information, related documents, copyright data, etc. Footer may be used directly under the body, or inside an individual article/section.3) <nav>can contain a group of links that point to other pages.4) <section>represent one paragraph/block of content.5) <aside>is a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content. It can be used for typographical effects like pull quotes or sidebars, for advertising, for groups of nav elements, and for other content that is considered separate from the main content of the page.2. Use the tag appropriately.1) Nesting the tags appropriately.Elements like div、ul、ol、dl、p cannot be nested in elements like a、span、strong、em、p、h1~h6.2) Caution on using too many div, span and table. Below are some standard uses of different html tags.<p> is used for text content/paragraphs.<dl> is used for defined list, e.g. list of headings, list of summaries.<ul> is for undefined list.<ol> is for ordered list.<h1>~<h6> is for content headings. There is only one H1 allowed on each page.<strong>/<em> is for important and emphasized text.<img> is for images. ALT tag is mandatory. Background and buttons should be handled by css not <img>.Any clock element that does not fit into the HTML5 tags can go into a div, but it has to have id property and label to clarify its purpose of use.3. Use appropriate form structure.1) Use fieldset to group the same fields.2) Use legend to name the different categories.3) Use CSS width to define the width of the textbox not the size property.4) Use maxlength to control the length of input.4. Set standards when naming the tags.1) Use 3 letter abbreviations as the suffix of id name for different tags. For example:Label: lblText: txtPassword: txtTextarea: txtFile: txtRadio: radCheckbox: chkSubmit: btnReset: btnButton: btnHidden: hid2) Name the class meaningfully.Use “-“to connect the words in the name.3) NameKeep it consistent to the id and use camel case, for example, id=”txt-id-card”, name=”idCard”.These are just some basic standards that we should follow in our practice in order to make search engines understand your web pages easier.Tags: HTML5, International, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Global','article'),(4501,'http://www.searchblog.asia/global/seo-global/exploring-search-engine-friendly-practice-in-html5-part-2/feed','','','','','others'),(4503,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/yahoo-china-shuts-down-music-search-functionality/attachment/yahoo-shuts-down-music-search-img/','Yahoo!

It’s big news but no surprise to see. To me there are two obvious reasons for this.1. Major eCommerce sites don’t like to be price-compared to other small Taobao shops via eTao. The high operating expense of major eCommerce sites, and their sourced products of legitimate brands make their products less competitive in price than those sold on small Taobao shops. Consequently, they dislike the current mechanism of eTao which sequences search results based on price (from low to high and from high to low), sales volume (from high to low) and default (more research will be done to find out more about the default mechanism).As the competitive advantages of 360Buy and Dangdang lie in its own brand and merchandise quality guarantee, eTao with price sequence criteria won’t contribute the visitors to them. While the mechanism of sequencing by sales volume, doesn’t work with 360Buy and Dangdang, which opposite to Taobao shops behavior, don’t disclose the sales volume of each individual product on page. Unless eTao adds the comments volume as one more sequence criteria, 360Buy and Dangdang won’t benefit from eTao.2. eCommerce sites don’t like their original content being stolen by search engines.Both 360Buy and Dangdang are trying hard to get their customers to leave comments on their merchandise to improve trustworthiness. According to Mr. Liu Qiangdong, the CEO of 360Buy, they spent 200 million RMB, either on gifts, points collected or discounts, to encourage their customers to comment on products after they bought them. eTao’s behavior of sending its spider to crawl the comments and display them on its search results page is nothing but theft.It is interesting to see similar disputes happening again between strong content providers and new search engines. If you remember I recently wrote about the fact that vertical travel search engine Qunar was sued by Ctrip for stealing comments generated by Ctrip users. For strong eCommerce sites like 360Buy and Dangdang, traffic is not a concern so getting presence on eTao and driving visitors from there is not a priority for them. On the contrary with Taobao being a major competitor, 360Buy and Dangdang prefer not to cooperate by getting indexed by eTao, a product considered owned by Taobao, though eTao has been running independently for a while.Opportunity for OthersI believe the above situation could represent a market opportunity for international eCommerce companies to explore. With the absence of major local competitors, the “inventory” of eTao (here refers the opportunity to get more presence on eTao when querying the same keywords as thousands of product pages of 360Buy and Dangdang are no longer competing) is more available.Therefore, I predict no additional eCommerce sites will follow the moves of 360Buy, DangDang, and Suning unless they are big enough and don’t wish to get any traffic from eTao.Tags: 360Buy, China, DangDang, E-Commerce, eTao, Suning, TaobaoCategory: E-commerce, E-commerce China','article'),(4522,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/e-commerce-china/major-ecommerce-sites-have-blocked-the-etao-spider-why-and-what-next/feed','','','','','others'),(4524,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/analytics-china/baidu-tongji-introduces-its-new-function-seo-suggestion/attachment/baidu-tonji-seo-suggestion/','Baidu Tonji SEO Suggestion','','','Category: ','article'),(4525,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/analytics-china/an-introduction-to-cnzz-web-analytics-in-china/attachment/cnzz-analytics-2/','CNZZ Analytics','','','Category: ','article'),(4526,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/analytics-china/competition-with-baidu-heats-up-after-alibaba-buys-web-analytics-provider-cnzz/attachment/cnzz-usage-chart/','CNZZ Usage Chart','','','Category: ','article'),(4527,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/ppc-china/rich-media-ads-vs-ppc/attachment/richmedia2/','richmedia2','','','Category: ','article'),(4528,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/ppc-china/rich-media-ads-vs-ppc/attachment/richmedia/','richmedia','','','Category: ','article'),(4529,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/ppc-china/rich-media-ads-vs-ppc/attachment/richmedia1/','richmedia1','','','Category: ','article'),(4530,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/ppc-china/rich-media-ads-vs-ppc/attachment/richmedia-icon/','richmedia-icon','','','Category: ','article'),(4531,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/Cresty%20Li/feed/','','','','','others'),(4532,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/the-largest-invisible-baidu-patron-healthcare-in-china/attachment/china-healthcare/','china healthcare','','','Category: ','article'),(4533,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/cnnic-published-china-search-engine-market-research-report-2011/attachment/china-search-engine-market-share-q3-2011-4/','China-Search-Engine-Market-Share-Q3-2011 – with English','','','Category: ','article'),(4534,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/cnnic-published-china-search-engine-market-research-report-2011/attachment/china-search-engine-market-share-q3-2011-1-2/','China-Search-Engine-Market-Share-Q3-2011- with English','','','Category: ','article'),(4535,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/cnnic-published-china-search-engine-market-research-report-2011/attachment/china-search-engine-market-share-q3-2011-2-2/','China-Search-Engine-Market-Share-Q3-2011- with English','','','Category: ','article'),(4536,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/cnnic-published-china-search-engine-market-research-report-2011/attachment/china-search-engine-market-share-q3-2011-3-2/','China-Search-Engine-Market-Share-Q3-2011- with English','','','Category: ','article'),(4537,'http://www.searchblog.asia/topics/seo/page/6/','SEO | Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Artist changed punctuation search on Baidu and Sogou People who are familiar with search engines know that the keywords to be used for search engines can be a mixture of Chinese, English, and numbers, and can also be one or more words, phrases, short words and sentences, but cannot be mere punctuations.

At its inception, Cuil looked pretty good on paper. The VCs thought so too, investing $33 million in the company. The broad experience of the management team, which included ex-Googlers and IBM executives and their alternative approach to search had many believing Cuil could succeed in providing an alternative to Google.So why did Cuil fail? Many reasons contributed to its lack of success but one truth is universal: in order to take market share from a giant in any market, the alternative proposition has to offer the consumer a real difference from what they already have without any drawbacks. Cuil did offer a true alternative in user interface. However, it fell down in one key area. Despite having the money and the team and the ‘Cuil’ interface, it was unable to beat or even equal Google in its core competency of providing relevant search results.State of PlayWith Yahoo no longer having its own search engine and Cuil shutting down, the search market in the United States is consolidating. Likely only two search engines will be left. In contrast, the China market is moving in the opposite direction. Baidu currently holds around 70 percent market share and this seems to be on the rise. Google has just over 24 percent and others including Sogou, Soso, and Youdao have around 6 percent combined.Me TooWith a search market worth an estimated $471 million and Baidu’s stock price continuing to increase, it is no surprise that more companies want in, even though the market is looking rather crowded. The ‘me too’ model has worked well for many companies in China in the past but any company coming in now will not be taking on an ill prepared foreign company feeling its way. Baidu is well funded, local, and massively dominant. So how do these companies expect to offer something that will gain market share? Is a small share of the massive China market enough? How many niches are there to exploit?Are We ‘Cuil’?Foreign companies have had their fair share of problems navigating the China market, frequently butting heads with the Chinese government. Google’s issues have been reported to death so I won’t cover them here, but it is certainly not alone. Microsoft is one foreign company that has been in China for some time and appears to understand it better than most. Of course, its interests are larger than just the search market, but from being nowhere with “Bing” it has been quietly plugging away furthering relationships and avoiding confrontations. For all its work, it has been rewarded in a number of ways. It is collaborating with Alibaba on its internal search tool 1688 and is now providing the organic search results for Taobao’s new ‘search engine’ Etao.com. More on that below.****UPDATE*** Bing is no longer providing organic search results to Etao.com and has been replaced by sogou.comE-Commerce Search Battle BeginsIn October, Taobao launched its own search engine called etao.com with interface as depicted below. Organic search results are available and powered by Bing but they are not in any position of prominence. Most of the results that appear at the top of the page relate to e-commerce. These e-commerce results come from Taobao itself. The main reason for Etao to exist is for e-commerce search and not to take on Baidu directly as a regular search engine.Rather than challenging Baidu, the creation of Etao is Taobao’s move to defend itself. In 2008, Baidu was fast becoming the main place for e-commerce search. When looking for consumer items, many organic results found on Baidu were coming from Taobao. No doubt, this was risky for Taobao. Baidu could easily start its own e-commerce site and divert traffic overnight to its new property. In a preemptive move, Taobao blocked Baidu’s robots from indexing its website. This essentially forced customers searching for consumer items to visit Taobao directly. However, Taobao mostly focused on content inside the site. It does not really provide all of the elements one would expect from a real search engine such as access to comparison sites, forums, and other useful resources needed when making a purchase. The newly launched Etao does.Baidu took time to get into the e-commerce space but now it has arrived. The joint venture announced with Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten means the resulting ‘RakuBai’ will compete head on with Taobao.***UPDATE***What’s the Bottom Line?There many other developments in the search engine scene in China of interest to practioners of Chinese SEO, but I will cover them another time.

Many people will know that Alibaba also owns Taobao which is a straight e-commerce site like Ebay.In November 2010, Etao launched its Open Search Beta service by integrating other B2C website data in addition to Taobao.com. To protect its user member’s interests, the following criteria must be met in order for data to be incorporated.1. Top 3 B2C eCommerce websites in the vertical industry.2. Stable and varied logistics channels, plus strong warehousing capabilities3. Good after sales service team, better with 400 / 800 pre dial hotline number4. Providing quality goodsSince this launch, a couple of medium B2C E-Commerce sites have been invited to submit to the Etao search engine, with users slowly now getting search results from domains other than Taobao.com. Since March 9th 2011, Etao officially indexed some big B2C eCommerce websites, including 360Buy, Vancl and Dangdang. It’s a great step for Etao, because without indexing content from these big 3 B2C websites, Etao cannot call itself an E-Commerce search engine. Just like you cannot imagine search on Baidu without news from Sina, Sohu and Netease.Etao is still in its infancy, and its Alexa ranking in China is 617, which is nothing compared to Baidu’s No. 1, Soso’s No. 9 and Sogou’s No.16. Therefore Dangdang, 360Buy and Vancl cannot expect to get much from Etao at the moment, whether in terms of traffic or sales. Rather, it’s a strategic decision to get a footstep in the first E-Commerce search engine in China, which hopefully will ultimately bring rewards.I believe that under the umbrella of the Alibaba Group and in cooperation with Microsoft Bing in China, Etao’s growth can be unlimited. In addition, the big 3 China E-Commerce sites might also get traffic or sales from Taobao, once Taobao aligns its internal search engine algorithm with Etao’s new change, as Taobao Search has already integrated information from Etao since November 2010. The purpose is to add product specifications, forums, Q&A’s and news along with the products displayed on Taobao’s search results, so as to make the offers more concrete and informative to customers.Whether Taobao ends up partially cannibalizing itself by diverting its members to other non-Taobao websites will depend on how Taobao positions itself, i.e. as closed kingdom or an open platform. We will see how it develops in the near future.Tags: 360Buy, Alibaba, B2C, China, DangDang, E-Commerce, Ebay, eTao, Taobao, VanclCategory: E-commerce, E-commerce China','article'),(4568,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/e-commerce-china/etao-open-search-indexes-dangdang-360buy-and-vancl/feed','','','','','others'),(4570,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-more-me-too-search-engines-in-china/attachment/cuil_logo/','Cuil Search Engine','','','Category: ','article'),(4571,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-more-me-too-search-engines-in-china/attachment/baidu-3/','Baidu Search Engine China','','','Category: ','article'),(4572,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-more-me-too-search-engines-in-china/attachment/etao-3/','Etao E-Commerce Search Engine China','','','Category: ','article'),(4573,'http://www.searchblog.asia/author/Richard%20Mabey/','Richard Mabey - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' Shanghai Surprise at SES Shanghai Shanghai SES was at the end of last month and I’ve got to say it was an amazing turnout and certainly larger than the first Asian SES event held in Hong Kong last September.

Unlike many of the countries with big internet markets, the main Korean search engines are local platforms, Naver and Daum. Naver and Daum take up more than 90 percent share in the Korean search engine market. The world’s biggest and most renowned search engine, Google, only takes up about 2 percent of the market share.Korea, with the 12th largest pool of internet users was among the first countries to receive internet connections which makes it not surprising that a lot of foreign companies want to enter the Korean market and consider Korean SEO strategies. The search culture and the user patterns of the Koreans are very different from others.Korean internet users, much like their western counterparts, tend to look at items towards the top of the results pages and are less likely to click on anything below the fold. Organic results on both Daum and Naver appear far down the page. In fact you need to scroll down the page to find them. This explains why Korean SEO has not really been that effective in the past with the only solution in gaining visibility on Korean search engines being to do paid search.Let’s take a closer look at the 3 search engines that make up the search market in South Korea.With a market share of 81%, Naver is the undisputed and most dominating search engine in South Korea. Most well known for its Q & A platform, Naver offers results within a wide range of categories including blogs, cafés (foreign equivalent of forum), videos, dictionaries, images, and books. Different from foreign search engines like Google and Yahoo, Naver’s rankings are not influenced by classic link-building, but on-site optimization and building links from Naver properties such as blogs does work as a strategy for Naver SEO.Daum is the second most-used search engine in South Korea and holds about 12% of the search engine market. It was one of the earliest portal sites before Naver to provide services like e-mail and social networking platforms called café. Although still visited by many users, more people prefer to perform their searches on Naver than Daum. Without a doubt, Daum’s biggest competitor, in terms of market share and presence, is Naver. Daum is not as quick as Naver or Google Korea to index new content and it does take some time to respond to SEO activities. Onsite optimization and building links from other Daum properties does work in getting higher rankings although Daum is hard to predict. Building Links from outside Korea has little or no impact from our experience.Though Naver surely is a dominant search engine in the Korean market, the introduction of Google Instant may finally improve Google’s position in the market. However, it still is a long way or may even be impossible for Google to overcome the high walls built over so many years by Naver and Daum.Google surely is the most trusted and influential search engine in the world. However, Google only takes up about 2% of the market in Korea. It does not discriminate the language that the keyword is in, whereas Naver and Daum do not show results if the keyword is in English. Compared to these local search engines Naver and Daum, Google Korea has far less paid ads on the results page and shows mostly organic results.This approach has been criticized as not being suitable for Korean tastes.For foreign companies who want to penetrate the Korean internet market, it is crucial that they study and fully understand these distinct differences in the market and Korea’s web system that remains unique from most of the countries in the world.Tags: Content Writing, Daum, Google, Google Korea, Korea, Naver, Onsite Optimization, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Korea','article'),(4592,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/seo-korea/seo-korea-korean-search-market-101/feed','','','','','others'),(4594,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/new-category-opencast-in-the-naver-universal-serp/attachment/naver-opencast-main/','Naver Opencast','','','Category: ','article'),(4595,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/new-category-opencast-in-the-naver-universal-serp/attachment/naver-opencast-tabs/','naver opencast tabs','','','Category: ','article'),(4596,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/new-category-opencast-in-the-naver-universal-serp/attachment/naver-se-results-img/','Naver SERP results','','','Category: ','article'),(4597,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/new-category-opencast-in-the-naver-universal-serp/attachment/naver-opencast-img/','Naver Opencast','','','Category: ','article'),(4598,'http://www.searchblog.asia/page/13/','SEO China, SEO Japan, SEO Korea : Search insights from Asia  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' An Introduction to Yahoo!

When some companies now re-do their website, they tend to upgrade to HTML5. HTML5 is becoming more and more popular, as the programmers feel that the old W3C HTML standard does not cater to their real world development needs. In HTML5, there are a lot of new attributes and tags which can be used for SEO as well. I will use couple of blog posts to share The Egg’s SEO standards in HTML5.1. Javascript must be placed in external files, the code must be placed before </head> or </body>.2. CSS must be placed in external files, and the code must be placed before </head> as well as before the JavaScript code.3. Do not use these elements: applet、basefont、center、dir、font、isindex、menu、s、strike、u、xmp.4. Follow xhtml 1.0 standard：1) Use lower case for tag name in all elements.2) There must be a value assigned for tag property, for example:<input checked=”checked”><input readonly=”readonly”><input disabled=”disabled”><option selected=”selected”>3) All the elements should be closed (special attention to p and li)；5. Elements such as meta, link, br, img, input should be closed with a slash at the end (e.g. <br />).All the form elements (such as input、select、textarea, except for button) must define name property.6. Page structure should not rely on Javescript. With Javascript forbidden, the page still be can be displayed normally, for example, user still can see the second level navigations.7. Must claim the DOCTYPE at the top of the page. Page must have html, head and body element. Title element must be included in <head> element. Below is a sample structure of standard HTML5 page<!dotype html><html lang=”zh-ch”><head><meta charset=”utf-8”><title>Page Title</title><link rel=”stylesheet” href=””><script src=””></script></head><body></body></html>In the next article, we will share more practices in HTML5.Tags: HTML5, International, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Global','article'),(4609,'http://www.searchblog.asia/global/seo-global/exploring-search-engine-friendly-practice-in-html5/feed','','','','','others'),(4611,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-internet-image-search-era-comes/attachment/china-image-search-comparison-chart-3/','China Image Search Comparison Chart','','','Category: ','article'),(4612,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-internet-image-search-era-comes/attachment/china-google-image-search/','China Google Image Search','','','Category: ','article'),(4613,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-internet-image-search-era-comes/attachment/china-sogou-image-search/','China Sogou Image Search','','','Category: ','article'),(4614,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-internet-image-search-era-comes/attachment/china-baidu-image-search/','China Baidu Image Search','','','Category: ','article'),(4615,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/social-media-china/baidu-new-product-xinzhi/attachment/baidu-xinzhi/','Baidu Xinzhi','','','Category: ','article'),(4616,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/social-media-china/baidu-new-product-xinzhi/attachment/baidu-xinzhi-2/','Baidu Xinzhi 2','','','Category: ','article'),(4617,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china-search-engine-market-share-q2-2011','China Search Engine Market Share Q2 2011','','An overview of China\'s search engine market share in Q2 of 2011 with some interesting findings with smaller search engines rapidly gaing ground on the larger ones...','A recent report published by Chinese research company iResearch suggests that Sogou has overtaken SOSO to become the third largest Search Engine in China, by number of search queries, after Baidu and Google.

The project these two Internet giants are working on at the moment encompasses the development of a search engine specifically made for the extremely popular content curation platform ‘Naver Matome’.This search engine will be deployed in two different ways: within the organic search results of Yahoo! Japan and as the internal search engine on the Naver Matome website itself.Naver Matome – A short OverviewThe Japanese content curation platform was launched in July 2009 and became very popular in the last couple years. In January 2013 it recorded no less than 1.28 billion page views and 41 million unique visitors.Like with any other content curation platform, the main goal is to categorise, organise and present already existing content on the Internet. Each page or ‘Matome’ is about a specific topic or keyword and is accessible to anyone for free as soon as it is published. In order to become a content curator, you simply need to sign up for a free account on Naver Japan. Creating a Matome is then very self-explanatory and uncomplicated as you can see in the screenshot below.Implications for SEO in JapanThe announced Naver Matome vertical results in the Yahoo! Japan’s SERPs might have a big impact on SEO in Japan depending on the implementation. This is especially the case because Matome results will be treated ‘with priority’, probably meaning that they might even appear above paid results.The project is planned to be implemented by the end of April at latest, then we will see how much of a priority Matome results will be given.Tags: Naver, SEO in Japan, Yahoo JapanCategory: Japan, SEO Japan','article'),(4643,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/naver-matome-now-included-in-yahoojapan-serp-search-engine-results-page/attachment/1-3/','1','','','Category: ','article'),(4644,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/naver-matome-now-included-in-yahoojapan-serp-search-engine-results-page/attachment/2-5/','2','','','Category: ','article'),(4645,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/sogou-confirmed-to-be-seeking-strategic-partnerships/attachment/sogou-main-3/','sogou-main','','','Category: ','article'),(4646,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/baidu-pushes-out-money-plant-algorithm-update/attachment/money-plant-main/','money-plant-main','','','Category: ','article'),(4647,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/google-drops-to-2-market-share-in-china-sees-mobile-search-as-last-bastion/attachment/google-drop-mainimage/','google-drop-mainimage','','','Category: ','article'),(4648,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/google-drops-to-2-market-share-in-china-sees-mobile-search-as-last-bastion/attachment/1/','google 2 % share drop 1','','','Category: ','article'),(4649,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/google-drops-to-2-market-share-in-china-sees-mobile-search-as-last-bastion/attachment/2/','2','','','Category: ','article'),(4650,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/google-drops-to-2-market-share-in-china-sees-mobile-search-as-last-bastion/attachment/3/','3','','','Category: ','article'),(4651,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/search-engine-market-share-update/attachment/marketshare-main/','marketshare-main','','','Category: ','article'),(4652,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/rumour-baidu-qihoo-tencent-seek-acquisition-of-sogou/attachment/sogou-main-2/','sogou-main','','','Category: ','article'),(4653,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/new-developments-in-the-japanese-social-media-industry/attachment/japan-social-mainimage/','japan-social-mainimage','','','Category: ','article'),(4654,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/baidu-and-360-sou-announce-100-fraud-protection-programs/attachment/360-mainimage/','360-mainimage','','','Category: ','article'),(4655,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/naver-search-results-new-social-sharing-options/attachment/social-sharein-serp-main/','Naver Social Sharing','','','Category: ','article'),(4656,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/naver-search-results-new-social-sharing-options/attachment/social-sharein-serp-img01/','Google social sharing','','','Category: ','article'),(4657,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/naver-search-results-new-social-sharing-options/attachment/social-sharein-serp-img02/','Naver mobile sharing','','','Category: ','article'),(4658,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/naver-search-results-new-social-sharing-options/attachment/social-sharein-serp-img03/','Naver desktop social sharing','','','Category: ','article'),(4659,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/google-implement-knowledge-graph-for-korea/attachment/google-kr-mainimage/','google-kr-mainimage','','','Category: ','article'),(4660,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/google-implement-knowledge-graph-for-korea/attachment/weather-serp/','weather SERP','','','Category: ','article'),(4661,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/google-implement-knowledge-graph-for-korea/attachment/img-serp-2/','IMG SERP 2','','','Category: ','article'),(4662,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/ppc-china/qihoo-360-search-quietly-launches-paid-search-platform/attachment/qihoo360-paid-search-main/','Qihoo360-Paid-Search-main','','','Category: ','article'),(4663,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/ppc-china/qihoo-360-search-quietly-launches-paid-search-platform/attachment/qihoo360-paid-search02/','Qihoo360-Paid-Search02','','','Category: ','article'),(4664,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/yahoojapans-first-mobile-serp-revamp-in-over-two-years/attachment/yahoo-mobile-mainimage/','yahoo-mobile-mainimage','','','Category: ','article'),(4665,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/yahoojapans-first-mobile-serp-revamp-in-over-two-years/attachment/serp-1/','SERP 1','','','Category: ','article'),(4666,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/yahoo-japan-releases-search-data-on-keywords-in-real-time/attachment/yahoo-search-data-main-img/','Yahoo!

The post goes on to explain that ICANN has approved a whole new range of domain endings in English, Chinese, Korean and Japanese to name a few.The new domain endings have led to multiple companies applying for the rights to administer them. Tencent and Sina have both applied for the .weibo extension in both Chinese and English languages, meaning that there’s a new arena for them to compete in if they don’t want to share the responsibility.ICANN’s list of applications also shows that Baidu has applied for .baidu, a step to protect its own brand name, whilst its search engine competitor Qihoo has opted to bid for phonetic translations of .cloud and .security; neither has applied for actual Chinese character extensions.The Wall Street Journal post also theorises that China’s Internet users may already be used to typing in domain endings in English. Considering that a large portion of users will use the pinyin method to input Chinese languages, it is a fair point and should have some weight.ICANN’s president Fady Chehadé firmly believes that the extensions will promote the Internet’s universality, in addition to witnessing a new wave of website registrations, saying, “In China the numbers will be staggering once we release the all Chinese character domain names.”It is fantastic news that the Internet will become more accessible to a wider number of people. For us, we’re obviously looking to see if these extra language domains will have any impact on search engine performance. I’m sure that we will find out in due course.Tags: China SEO, ICANN, Sina Weibo, Tencent WeiboCategory: SEO China','article'),(4670,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/chinese-language-top-level-domains-coming-in-2013/feed','','','','','others'),(4672,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/seo-korea/seo-on-naver-new-guidelines-after-the-latest-algorithm-update/attachment/seo-on-naver-img/','SEO Naver update','','','Category: ','article'),(4673,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/baidus-lenovo-a586-launched/attachment/a586-img/','Lenovo A586','','','Category: ','article'),(4674,'http://www.searchblog.asia/increasing-mobile-phone-usage-makes-voice-search-imperative','Redesigns For Japan Search Engine Results Pages','','November seemed to be the month where Japan\'s search engines decided to change their results pages. Both major search engines, Google Japan and Yahoo! Japa','November seemed to be the month where Japan’s search engines decided to change their results pages. Both major search engines, Google Japan and Yahoo! Japan, changed the design of their search engine results pages (SERPs). Here’s a look at how they’re looking since the changes were rolled out.Google Japan revamping the SERPsThis news probably won’t come as a surprise to other Google users outside of Japan. After Google US started implementing the new SERP design on 6 November, two weeks later Google Japan applied these changes to their SERPs as well. The search tools, which used to be on the left side of the result pages, are now at the top. This redesign opens up more space for the results in general and the knowledge graph/Google+ results on the right hand side.The next image shows an example of the second change relating to Google+ results. This section is either reserved for the knowledge graph for searches of informative nature, or for the Google+ page for searches on businesses or brands.The Google+ graph gives a short introduction of the profile with the most important facts and snippets of the latest posts made on the profile.Yahoo!Japan Renewing Their Real-time Result PageAfter the latest integration of Facebook in the real-time search results, Yahoo! Japan seems to have decided to implement some more updates and improvements for the real-time search category.This time, the desktop version as well as the mobile version experienced some major updates regarding user experience and design. SERP structure and elements were replaced or redesigned. The keyword graph is now on the top right and above the current hot topic keyword terms.Older search results are now loaded by just scrolling down, and therefore work the same way as on Twitter.The design of the tool bar on the top also changed and buttons were replaced with drop down menus to make it look cleaner.The user interface for the mobile version went through an even bigger makeover with a new design of the SERP and a new navigation menu.Yahoo! Japan announced that these changes are just the beginning and that further updates and improvement in regards to user experience are going to be made in future.Tags: Google Japan, SEO in Japan, Yahoo JapanCategory: SEO, SEO Japan','article'),(4675,'http://www.searchblog.asia/chinas-search-engine-war-continues','China’s Search Engine War Continues','','','After Google CN got out of the Chinese search market, the situation become like this: Baidu is the dominant player, whilst Sougou and Soso pick up Google’s share. For the last two years, this has been the state of play in the market. However, with the commencement of 3B WAR, Qihoo 360 has come into the public eye as a search engine, although it’s better known as anti-virus software and a browser. What’s more, it has even caught up with Sogou and Soso, achieving the second position of the Chinese search market.On 15 August, 360 Search came out and the “3B War” (360 vs. Baidu) began to appear. As 360 Browser already has many users, 360 Search will use this advantage as its weapon to fight for this war. The first step was to change the default search engine from Google CN to 360 Search, which signaled Qihoo 360’s entry into the “search battlefield”.Whether it’s deliberate or not, this can be taken as 360 Search challenging Baidu and will take some search market share from Baidu. In fact, 360’s market share is growing rapidly, which has exerted pressure on Baidu. You can read about the initial jousting in Baidu’s defence against 360 Search in Daniel’s post.360 Search’s latest reaction is to perform some IE kernel modifications, which causes users to access Baidu products through 360 search in IE and 360 browser, without forced Baidu’s forced redirection.Traffic to Baidu properties referred from 360 Search behaves differently on different browsersTo increase their chances of winning this battle, Baidu even partnered with Tencent, who is the opponent of Qihoo 360 and also of Baidu itself to some extent. Baidu will share their database with Tencent, while Tencent will join the Baidu “Security Alliance” and invest 10 billion to set up a safety fund, which fight against 360 of the safety field in return.This war will impact the search market greatly as Baidu looks to defend its highest market share. If Baidu and 360 Search can compete on algorithm improvements or new ideas to get better search results, this will have a positive impact for the entire search industry for users. Conversely, if they just do underhand little tricks against each other rather than enhance themselves, it will probably have the opposite effect. Users will have to bear the brunt of it for better or worse.3B WAR is still ongoing. What will Qihoo 360 and Baidu do next? Not only their competitors, but also the users are watching what will happen later. We hope that the search engine developers can improve user experience to achieve its own share of growth, rather than simply outwitting opponents. We appeal: healthy competition, better result for end users!Tags: Baidu, China SEO, Qihoo 360, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4676,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/increasing-mobile-phone-usage-makes-voice-search-imperative/attachment/voicesearch-img/','Baidu, Google and Sugou search','','','Category: ','article'),(4677,'http://www.searchblog.asia/korea/seo-korea/the-new-naver-trends-keyword-tool-for-korean-seo/trackback/','The New ‘Naver Trend’ Keyword Tool for Korean SEO','','The new Naver keyword tool \'Naver trend\' gives unique insights into the Korean search market and is a useful SEO tool for your Korean SEO','On October 30th, the biggest search engine in Korea introduced its new Keyword trend tool ‘Naver trend’. This keyword tool is Naver’s equivalent to Google trends, and offers unique insights in its database.Naver trend might be particularly interesting for analysing seasonal or event-based traffic performances of certain keywords in the past. Needless to say that the insights could be of great value for Korean SEO and PPC campaigns in particular and marketing campaigns in general. Just as with Google trends, different options and features are offered in Naver’s keyword trends tool. It is possible to compare up to five keywords and blend in news headlines in order to get a better understanding of the traffic peaks.The first options one can choose from are the two categories ‘web searches’ and ‘mobile searches’. Combined results of both sources are not provided at this stage. Regarding the date range, one month, three months, one year, the whole record, or a custom range can be chosen and the records go all the way back to January 2007. Results can be downloaded as .csv files.Similar to Google trends, results are only in relative numbers, whereas ‘100’ illustrates the highest traffic point of the researched keyword within the chosen time period. All other results are measured relatively to that peak traffic point.Naver Trend has just been released and is still in Beta phase. It might therefore still have some points to improve, but Naver claims that it is going to further develop the tool and provide better results in future. From an SEO point of view, this is a great tool to get some insights in the very complicated Korean search landscape. Let’s wait and see and hope that Naver will release further tools to help us understanding the market better.What do you think about this new tool? Do you have any experience with similar tools for the Korean market?

The updates result in significant impact on both indexation and rankings of thousands of websites.','Baidu has been implementing big algorithm updates since April, and the updates have had a significant impact on both indexation and rankings of thousands of websites. It seems that the updates are ongoing and it has been widely reported that two major updates happened in the past month, one on June 22, 2012 and the other on June 28, 2012. These updates have also been acknowledged by Baidu Engineer “Lee” from Baidu’s anti-spam team. This is quite a new development for Baidu SEO as previously Baidu generally did not acknowledge when changes had been made and it was left to the blogosphere to piece together what had happened.So what’s the update about? According to Lee, the June 21, 2012 update implemented anti-spam measures targeting poor quality websites. Poor quality websites have long time appeared in Baidu search results and of course Baidu is concerned this will lead to a poor user experience for searchers. Lee defined poor quality websites as those that have very poor content and in particular “spun” content. The sole purpose of these websites is for manipulating the search results, a common practice in Baidu SEO.After this June 22nd update, many webmasters complain that their sites lost significant rankings or disappeared altogether. Most of those complaining were SME company websites that do not update their content frequently. Lee did acknowledge that generally they can accurately identify and remove websites with poor content but “collateral damage” is hard to avoid. If this happens to your website, you could report it through http://tousu.baidu.com/webmaster/suggest. Lee also said this is the start of a series of action; however, Baidu will in future make announcements on big updates through the recently launched Baidu Webmaster Tools. If you don’t have Baidu Webmaster Tools set up, now might be a good time.This is really a wake-up call to all webmasters and especially those who attempt to create dozens of websites in order to manipulate the search results. Just like with Google in the past, Baidu SEOers may have to work a little harder than before to get results!Reference: Lee’s letter to webmasters is posted in Chinese on http://bbs.zhanzhang.baidu.com/thread-6533-1-1.html.Tags: Baidu, Baidu algorithm change, Baidu SEO, Baidu update, Baidu Webmaster Tools, China SEO, Link Building for BaiduCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4690,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/baidu-seo-impacted-by-major-algorithm-updates/feed','','','','','others'),(4696,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/baidu-now-shows-sina-weibo-in-search-results/attachment/baidu-sina/','baidu-sina','','','Category: ','article'),(4697,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/baidu-now-shows-sina-weibo-in-search-results/attachment/baidu-sina2/','baidu-sina2','','','Category: ','article'),(4698,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/dead-link-management-baidu-webmaster-tools-new-feature/attachment/baidu-dead-link-management-tool/','Baidu Dead Link Management Tool','','','Category: ','article'),(4699,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/dead-link-management-baidu-webmaster-tools-new-feature/trackback/','Dead Link Management – Baidu Webmaster Tools New Feature','','Baidu has been criticized by webmasters for displaying cached links that have been removed from websites.

As a response to that, Baidu launched a new feature in its Beta version Webmaster Tools, i.e. Dead Link Management.Webmasters are always optimizing, updating or eliminating obsolete pages, and that will result in many dead links of 404 pages. If those page links were crawled and indexed by Baidu before being removed from the website, they will remain in Baidu’s indexation pool till Baidu detects them. However, Baidu holds a huge indexation database, and it takes Baidu spider a long period to detect and eliminate the dead links from its SERP. To speed up the process, Baidu advocates webmasters pushing the dead link information to Baidu, rather than waiting for Baidu spider to find out.How to use the Dead Link Management ToolStep 1: Create a dead link fileGo through the website, list all dead links and change the page status to 404. Create the dead link list in the same way as creating sitemap XML file. http://www.baidu.com/search/sitemap_help.htmlStep 2: Upload the dead link file to the root directory of the website.Step 3: Log in Baidu Webmaster Tools, and click the button of Site Management (站点管理) on the left sidebar to verify the website belonging to you.

The main spirit of SMO is connecting tightly with social media platforms in order to convert those users with your valuable content into customers or others who free ‘talk’ about what you are doing to others, then drive more target traffic to your website. When SMO came out, China’s SNS and microblogging were not as popular as now. In my personal view, it’s a good time to lay store by SMO. Let’s see the image of China’s social media landscape below:Source:http://www.simonbai.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/social_media_marketing.jpgContrast the outer rings with the simple inner ring of the world’s social media landscape. China’s social media landscape after several years of development is essentially similar to the world’s social media integration pattern. However, the social networking community formed by Chinese owns its cultural uniqueness. Currently China’s social media presents a flourishing state with no portal website dominating in every single part. But some portals perform prominently in some of the parts. For instance, Sina has a wide range of business but the most outstanding parts are Blogging, Microblogging and Q&A platform. In a separate breakdown of each area, the competition is always high; only one or two websites are the leader in the area. As a popular saying goes, “Huge market has tremendous opportunities.” Some companies focus on one area of social media optimization to promote sales. Now take an imperfect example of eLong Microblogging for reference.ELong’s performance was striking in the past year. In the third quarter, eLong retained profit is $ 9.4 million RMB compared to 1.2 million RMB last year, an increase of 683%. As an ordinary user, I also felt eLong visibility increased and recognition improved. This increasing profit of course ties in closely with its effective online marketing. SMO is a part of eLong online marketing strategy, and microblogging is the most intuitive SMO expression.From the above image, we can see the following information:* ELong fans: ELong has the largest scale fans, 105 million, on Sina microblogging compared to Ctrip’s 17 million and 17u’s 58 million. ELong Microblogging started early and developed rapidly; this leads eLong to attract early customers and establish reputation.* Series of sub-brand: Elong established its series of sub-brand microblogging by dividing the microblogs by different types of service: book hotel; eLong group buy; eLong tour guide and so on. I think it’s a smart idea to separate different services because it enables users to find what they need easily. 17u also set up some series brands, but I think it’s not better than eLong’s.* New activities development: Booking hotel through Microblog; check vacant rooms before group buy; check in hotel online and Last Minutes hotel promotion. Service diversification and humanization have made eLong hotel sales dramatically increase.* Microblogging forward number: eLong updates microblogging frequently and its usual mode is a short text with an attractive image. I don’t think the mode is special or good enough. But the forward number is generally hundreds.The above is a simple eLong microblogging analysis; even if the number of fans is not able to explain the marketing effect, we can clearly see eLong microblogging investment and the hard work. At least on Microblogging, eLong is doing better than the OTA giant Ctrip and its peers. Though there is no an accurate data provided so far, in my opinion, eLong’s profit enhancement this year has a significant contribution from microblogging.From the development of the Internet to present, search engines are not the unique entrance to Internet. Social media has become one of user Internet portals, and has a tendency to expand rapidly. When we develop SEO strategies, we should not only consider the feelings of the search engines but also should try to consider a whole SMO plan, to complement and benefit our SEO strategies.Tags: China, Elong, Microblogs, SEO, Sina, SMO, Social MediaCategory: SEO, SEO China, Social, Social Media China','article'),(4724,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/social-media-china/what-about-adding-smo-into-seo-strategy-in-china/feed','','','','','others'),(4727,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/mobile-search-a-huge-market-and-business-opportunity/attachment/mobile-search-1/','Mobile Search 1','','','Category: ','article'),(4728,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/mobile-search-a-huge-market-and-business-opportunity/attachment/mobile-search-2/','Mobile Search 2','','','Category: ','article'),(4729,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/mobile-search-a-huge-market-and-business-opportunity/attachment/mobile-search-3/','Mobile Search 3','','','Category: ','article'),(4730,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/mobile-search-a-huge-market-and-business-opportunity/attachment/mobile-search-4/','Mobile Search 4','','','Category: ','article'),(4731,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/common-incidences-that-cause-baiduspider-crawling-failure/attachment/baidu-spider/','Baidu Spider','','','Category: ','article'),(4732,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-search-social-integration-baidu-and-soso-index-microblog-content/attachment/box-microblog-2/','Box Microblog','','','Category: ','article'),(4733,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-search-social-integration-baidu-and-soso-index-microblog-content/attachment/box-microblog-2-2/','Box Microblog 2','','','Category: ','article'),(4734,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-search-social-integration-baidu-and-soso-index-microblog-content/attachment/box-microblog-3/','Box Microblog 3','','','Category: ','article'),(4735,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/social-media-china/will-sina-microblog-be-the-first-successful-solomo-in-china/attachment/solomo-games/','SoLoMo – Games','','','Category: ','article'),(4736,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/social-media-china/will-sina-microblog-be-the-first-successful-solomo-in-china/attachment/solomo-china/','SoLoMo – China','','','Category: ','article'),(4737,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/social-media-china/will-sina-microblog-be-the-first-successful-solomo-in-china/attachment/solomo-sina/','SoLoMo – Sina','','','Category: ','article'),(4738,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/time-to-pay-attention-on-sogou-seo-in-china/attachment/china-search-market-share-report-sogou-and-google/','China Search Market Share Report – Sogou and Google','','','Category: ','article'),(4739,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/seo-japan/link-building-in-japan/trackback/','Link Building in Japan','','An analysis of good link building practice for Japan from our resident Japanese SEO expert Hiroshi Oyo','Link building is one of the controversial topics today and there is no difference in Japan. With the integration of Yahoo Japan using Google’s algorithm, the focus on conducting SEO with Google’s algorithm in mind has never been greater.As we all know, quality incoming links from relevant sources are valued more highly by Google than are irrelevant links. Historically, Yahoo has not placed as much importance on the incoming link quality in determining rankings, so as Yahoo is the dominant search engine in Japan but is now using Google’s algorithm, it is more important than ever to focus more on quality links. It is better to get 1 quality link from a good relevant site than 100 links from an irrelevant site (you might even get penalized with this method if you consistently get links from such spam sites).So how to get good quality links? Content!Spend time reaching out to bloggers in Japan with the same interests as the field your company is in. If you can develop good relationships with bloggers and you have good content they are likely to write about your company and link to your site as well. Remember, content is your treasure. Make sure you have good quality informative content in your site and don’t expect to receive many incoming links or to rank highly in the search engine results pages if you don’t.With the Panda updates and algorithm changes Google consistently has, the search engines are only getting smarter. If you want to expand your back-links, make an interesting site that is useful for people as well as write more content, articles and news that is interesting and informative. This is also now the case for Japan as previously it has been for many other countries where Google dominates the search market.Like I mentioned in my previous post, choose the right keywords and optimize correctly and have fresh new content updated regularly and people will find it useful and interesting and they will link to your site and spread the word for you about your products and services as well.“There is no shortcut to success”Tags: Content Writing, Japan, Link Building, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Japan','article'),(4740,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/seo-japan/link-building-in-japan/feed','','','','','others'),(4742,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-search-engine-market-share-q2-2011/attachment/chain-search-engine-market-share-q2-2011/','china-search-engine-market-share-q2-2011','','','Category: ','article'),(4743,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-search-engine-market-share-q2-2011/trackback/','China Search Engine Market Share Q2 2011','','An overview of China\'s search engine market share in Q2 of 2011 with some interesting findings with smaller search engines rapidly gaing ground on the larger ones...','A recent report published by Chinese research company iResearch suggests that Sogou has overtaken SOSO to become the third largest Search Engine in China, by number of search queries, after Baidu and Google.

Here in this article I will provide some tips regarding choosing subdomains or subdirectories to organize content of your site.How search engines treat subdomains and subdirectories?A URL like news.example.com is a URL using a subdomain and news.example.com here is a subdomain under top-level domain example.com. An example for a subdirectory is a URL like example.com/article/, where here the directory article is a subdirectory under the web root.From the perspective of search engines, content on different domains or subdomains are treated as content from different websites. And content on the same domain or subdomain is treated as content from the same site. For example, content on example.com, news.example.com and buy.example.com is treated as coming from different sites. Content on example.com/news/ and example.com/buy/ is treated as from the same site example.com.Subdomains or Subdirectories?Since all subdomain pages are treated as independent sites from each other and from top-level domain sites, they won’t affect the search engine ranking between each other. But when considering creating more content to generate more traffic from search engines, we should try to take advantage of existing resources. Search engines tend to give higher ranking to pages from old sites that are trusted or have higher weight and reputation.If you have a good old site and consider adding more content on same topic, using subdirectories may make the new pages get good rankings more quickly. But if the content you are going to add is rich enough to support an independent site or the subject is new content which is not relevant to the existing content, then you should consider using subdomains to organize it.Another thing to consider is whether it is convenient for you/your company to maintain the sites, because sites using subdirectories just often put the code in same space but subdomains might not and might require different codes or CMS and sometimes might even be hosted on different servers. Content in subdirectories is much easier to edit or change and content entered into different subdomains is a little more difficult to manage.In summary – Best Practice1. If the content is not rich enough to support a new site, put it in subdirectories under the old site to make it get good rankings quickly; when the content is rich enough, then consider transferring it to a subdomain for easier management.2. Use subdomains to organize content which is different from content on other pages.3. Avoid distributing duplicated content between different domains/subdomains.4. Avoid abusing subdomains. Do not use subdomains to set up a large number of sites if you don’t have enough content to support the sites’ topic.Tags: International, SEO, Site Architecture, sub-directories, SubdomainsCategory: SEO, SEO Global','article'),(4747,'http://www.searchblog.asia/global/seo-global/when-to-use-subdomains-or-subdirectories/feed','','','','','others'),(4750,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/how-far-baidu-will-go-to-monopolize-the-internet-market-in-china/attachment/baidu-new-features/','Baidu New Features','','','Category: ','article'),(4751,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/how-far-baidu-will-go-to-monopolize-the-internet-market-in-china/attachment/baidu-new-features-2/','Baidu New Features 2','','','Category: ','article'),(4752,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/the-importance-of-seoing-your-website-images-for-seo-in-china-and-elsewhere/attachment/seo-image-for-search-blog-asia/','SEO Image for Search Blog Asia','','','Category: ','article'),(4753,'http://www.searchblog.asia/global/seo-global/seo-strategy-for-multi-regional-and-multilingual-sites/trackback/','SEO Strategy for Multi-regional and Multilingual Sites','','Suggestions from our SEO Specialist Felix Cen on how to best structure Multi-Regional and Multi-Lingual websites for SEO in China, Japan, Thailand, etc','1. Multi-regional and Multilingual SitesIf a website explicitly targets its users in different countries/regions, it can be called a multi-regional website, for example, a website that serves people from both Singapore and China. Additionally, a multilingual website obviously means any website that offers content in more than one language, like for example in English and Chinese. Many websites are both multi-regional and multilingual, e.g. a site might have different versions for Thailand and Singapore and, provide both Thai and English for the Thai, and both Chinese and English for the Singaporeans.It is quite common for global companies to set up such websites to serve their clients all around the world. So it’s an important Search Engine Optimization (SEO) issue to deal with when handling multi-regional and multilingual sites in order to make them search engine friendly.2. How Search Engines Determine the LanguageAs Google has declared, it uses only the visible content on the webpage to determine its language. Not any source code information such as “lang” attributes would help Google determine the language. When considering the language issue, search engines won’t take a whole site as an assessment unit. What they care about is that what is a specific webpage’s language is, that is, search engines determine language only at the page level.To avoid making search engines confused and to help them determine the language correctly, only one language should be used on each page, both in content and navigation. The website can include web pages in several languages, but every page should include only one language.3. Targeting Site to a Specific Country and Taking Advantage of Localization For search engines, they always try to show users the best possible search results, and generally those results are going to be pages that are localized for the user’s location and/or in the user’s language, which means that if the search engines think that your site serves a specific region/language, pages on your site tend to be returned by search engines and might have better ranking in that region/language.If search engines understand your site’s target country, this may also help to improve the quality of the search results and rankings for your site’s pages. The following elements will help search engines to determine a website’s targeted country:* Country-code top-level domain names, or ccTLDs, for example, .cn would tell search engines that the site is targeting in China and .jp is for Japan.* Geotargeting settings. Geotargeting means determining the geographic location of a website. You can use this function provided by Google Webmaster Tools to indicate to Google which country your site is targeting.* Server location, which is determined by the IP address of the server.For sites in single languages or targeting only one country, it’s much easier to make them understand by search engines than for multi-regional and multilingual sites. To keep the coherence of the web content and make it easier to geotarget parts of your site to different regions, content of multi-regional and multilingual sites in different languages should be organized well.Using a good URL structure coordinate with different language is a good way to help geotarget parts of the sites. Below is a table which shows several URL structure for optional:4. Common Problems and Best SEO Practice for Multi-regional and multilingual SitesFrom the perspective of search engines, pages that provide the same content in different languages would not be considered as duplicate content, and are actually quite user-friendly to provide content in different languages to visitors from different countries or regions.From another perspective, by creating several language versions of the webpage and helping search engines to index them all, would provide the website a better chance to get traffic from regions using different languages.One common problem involving multi-lingual sites is the automatic redirection based on the user’s perceived language (based on the IP address/cookie/browser language, etc.), which could prevent users and search engines from viewing all versions of the website, especially when there is not a cross-link between each language version of the site.Another more serious problem is that the website server can return different versions of the web pages in the same URL according to different users’ perceived languages. This may confuse search engines and visitors as well as to what is the exact language and content of the page (only one specific URL). To make the site search engine friendly, different content must be used for each different URL.Since we know that there is no problem for search engines to determine the pages’ language if there isn’t more than one language within each webpage, we can organize different language parts of the multi-regional and multi-lingual site well to help search engines understand each part and thereby help the sites pages get better rankings.Below are some steps you can follow when planning or optimizing your multi-regional and multilingual sites:* Decide to use country-code top-level domain names or sub domains or subdirectories to organize different parts of the site. Choose ccTLDs, subdirectories or sub domains depending on your company’s specific situation, such as your company’s budget, site scale and so on.* Create different versions of web pages on the site in different languages to suit different visitors. Each page should be created in only one language and each language version of the pages should have their own URLs.* Organize pages in same language together and put them into different country-level domains or sub directories or sub domains.* Set up Cross-links between different language parts of the site and link each language version together.* Add the site to Google Webmaster Tool and set geotargeting for each part to indicate their targeted countries.Tags: Geotargeting, International, mult--regional websites, multi-lingual websites, SEO, Site Architecture, sub-directories, SubdomainsCategory: SEO, SEO Global','article'),(4754,'http://www.searchblog.asia/global/seo-global/seo-strategy-for-multi-regional-and-multilingual-sites/feed','','','','','others'),(4756,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-seo-tips-to-improve-your-indexation-on-baidu/attachment/anjuke-and-mytophome-image-2/','Anjuke and Mytophome Image','','','Category: ','article'),(4757,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-seo-tips-to-improve-your-indexation-on-baidu/trackback/','China SEO Tips to Improve Your Indexation on Baidu','','Some Tips on how to improve your websites Indexation and Footprint on Baidu for SEO based on observations from the website architectures of two of China\'s largest property related websites','I have recently checked several top Chinese property websites, which of course focus on Baidu, as their visitors are the mass audiences who tend to go to Baidu, and found that their results on Baidu are amazing.Both of Anjuke and Mytophome have achieved multiple times the amount of indexation on Baidu than on Google. What a huge difference compared to those international company websites, which have the situation the other way around!By looking into the structure, sitemap, links, etc, I summarized a few tips that might be useful for Baidu Indexation.1. Flat Website Architecture/structureBoth Anjuke and Mytophome use lot of sub-domains. Each city is assigned with a sub-domain of city.domain.com. In total Anjuke has 25 city based sub-domains. Mytophome has 8 city based plus function based subdomains, such as ask, news and maps, etc. Since Baidu spider’s crawling performance decreases more when the longer URL is, architecture with sub-domains that makes the whole website flatter and URL shorter is preferred by Baidu spider.2. HTML Sitemap PagesBaidu hasn’t launched its Webmaster Tools yet, so sitemap.xml and robots.txt that are used to submit to Google Webmaster Tools, are not working well with Baidu spider. The temporary solution for Baidu spider is to go to html sitemap page. Each individual city-based sub-domain of Anjuke has an independent html sitemap page, so in total it has 25 sitemap html pages. Such a large number of sitemap pages helps the Baidu spider to index.3. Local Link BuildingLocal link building plays an important role in Baidu indexation. According to Open Site Explorer, Anjuke has 164,005 offsite links and Mytophome has 15,080. Such large numbers of offsite links are crucial to support the same level of web pages getting indexed by Baidu.4. Language and ContentBaidu spider tends to crawl Chinese, both traditional and simplified, and Japanese. It does crawl English pages too, but its algorithm usually gives more preference to web pages that provide translation services, as most Baidu visitors tend to look for the Chinese meaning of the English terms. Therefore, localizing your page well by putting Chinese in the title, meta, H tags and text is very crucial.5. Baidu MapsThe Baidu algorithm ususally favors its own products, as we have seen from the lawsuit that Hudong accused Baidu for making Baidu Baike rank higher than Hudong. This can be applied to Baidu maps, as the Baidu spider tends to crawl websites more often with Baidu products. As location matters for online property searching, Anjuke uses maps to guide users to find their apartments. Baidu maps was opted for by Anjuke over Google maps, as it tends to get better results in location-based terms’ search. Just like registering your location on Google maps will benefit from Google universal search, integrating Baidu maps into the system will definitely help Anjuke’s properties listed on maps to achieve a better position than its competitors.Tags: Baidu, China, SEO, Site IndexationCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4758,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/china-seo-tips-to-improve-your-indexation-on-baidu/feed','','','','','others'),(4760,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/how-the-baidu-spider-reacts-to-common-http-status-codes/trackback/','How the Baidu spider reacts to common HTTP status codes','','An explanation of how the Baidu Spider reacts to different HTTP staus codes and recommendations regarding the best status codes to use for different situations when doing SEO in China','There is a semi-official group on Baidu Tieba where Baidu tech staff Lee answers SEO questions from webmaster representatives. According to a recent post from Lee, he reveals how the Baidu spider treats different HTTP status codes and provides some suggestions when using those status codes.404 Not FoundIf the URL returns the status code 404, Baidu will think the page is no longer in service and normally will also remove the page from the search results. If the Baidu spider discovers this URL again, it will not crawl the page.503 Service UnavailableIf the URL returns the 503 status code, Baidu will think the website is temporarily not able to be visited. It’s normally caused by the temporary shutdown of the website or limited bandwidth. The Baidu spider will not remove the URL from its database and will visit again later. By the next time the spider comes, if it returns normal, the spider will crawl the site as normal. If it still returns 503, the Baidu spider will still keep coming back a few times. However, if the page keeps returning the 503 status code, Baidu will treat it as a broken link and remove it from its search results.403 ForbiddenIn the case when the URL returns the code 403, Baidu will think the website is forbidden to visit the page for the time being. Under such circumstances, if it’s a new URL to the Baidu spider, Baidu will not crawl it and will come back again later to check. If it’s an existing URL, Baidu will not remove it immediately and will come back again later to check. However, if the Baidu spider keeps getting the 403 status code, it will eventually remove the URL from its search results.301 Moved PermanentlyIf the status code 301 is returned, Baidu will think the page is redirected to the new URL. Using a 301 is recommended when migrating a website, changing a domain or updating a website. Lee also admits that it takes a bit longer for Baidu to process 301’s.Lee also made some suggestions on choosing the right HTTP Status Code for different situations as follows:-1. When the website is temporarily down and people cannot open web pages, try using 503’s instead of 404’s. The 503 tells the Baidu spider the site is temporarily down and please come back later.2. When you experience bandwidth pressure from spider crawling, again use a 503 rather than a 404 to make sure the spider will come at another time.3. Sometimes you want Baidu to index completed pages and reviewed content. Then you can use the 403 status code for the new content or pages until you complete and review the pages.4. When changing domains or migrating websites, use 301’s to redirect the old URL to new URL.Tags: Baidu, Baidu Spider, China, Robots, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4761,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/how-the-baidu-spider-reacts-to-common-http-status-codes/feed','','','','','others'),(4765,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/shanghai-surprise-at-ses-shanghai/attachment/richard-at-ses-shanghai-2/','richard at ses shanghai 2','','','Category: ','article'),(4766,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/shanghai-surprise-at-ses-shanghai/attachment/ses_richardmabey/','SES Shanghai Presentation by Richard Mabey','','','SES Shanghai Presentation by Richard MabeyCategory: ','article'),(4767,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/the-value-of-link-building-to-baidu-optimization-since-its-algorithm-change/attachment/baidu-seo-link-building/','baidu-seo-link-building','','','Category: ','article'),(4768,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/beware-of-blackhat-seo-agencies-in-china-taking-advantage-your-website/trackback/','Beware of Blackhat SEO Agencies in China taking advantage of your website','','A guide from Daniel Cai on how to keep your website in China safe from hackers using tools to insert links to their own sites from your website.','When I am doing research for competitor link profiles, I often see some websites which have been hacked by other blackhat SEO agencies which have inserted some code to provide links for other websites. Normally the webmasters will not notice they have been hacked by looking at the website. The webpage layout will be the same as usual and just some hidden JS code will be inserted in the homepage.Baidu will actually send an email to alert webmasters if Baidu thinks the site is hacked. The email will be sent to the email address that is used for the domain registration. Those blackhat SEO agencies normally use a tool to help them hack a group of websites. Once they successfully hack the website, they will upload content and links that will benefit them. Baidu also gives 8 recommendations to all the webmasters to stay away from such trouble as follows:-1. If you use any open-source, change the default names. The blackhat SEO agencies normally use tools to scan files to figure out what technology you use.2. Change the default usernames and passwords for admin.

Japanese constitutes of 3 types of characters, “Hiragana”, “Katakana” and “Kanji”. Depending on certain keywords or phrases, certain types of characters are used rather than the other which makes Japanese SEO even more complex.For example, if you want to target a keyword “Mobile Phone”, there are multiple ways of writing it. One would be “携帯電話” (Kanji), “携帯” (Kanji) and “ケータイ” (Katakana). By definition “携帯” means to carry, but if you search it as a keyword, most first page results in Yahoo and Google Japan will be about Mobile phones. Also the search volume for the word 携帯is higher as it is more generic.Another difficulty is that certain words in Japanese can be pronounced the same, written the same in Hiragana, and mean more or less the same. The word “あう” (Hiragana) can be written as “会う” (Kanji), “逢う” (Kanji), “遭う” (Kanji). All of these words mean “Meet”, but each word is used in different contexts. There are many translation sites like Google translate that people may rely on, but the translations given often fail to be accurate for the context and can only lead to further confusion and incorrect keywords being chosen.Japanese tends to make abbreviations in many words and one great example is the phrase mobile phone I have used. “ケータイ” is an abbreviation of “携帯電話” and when speaking most people say it in the abbreviated format rather than the full. A search result will show you some proof that there are significant search results for the abbreviation ケータイ, which are 450,000 monthly local searches, while携帯電話, has 823,000 monthly local searches. So there is enough demand and searches for the abbreviated term and because it has become so common, the word itself already stands as a strong keyword to be considered for mobile phones in Japan.The above example clearly demonstrates the difficulties in selecting the right keywords to be optimized for in Japanese since translation sites or services may not often offer abbreviated terms for specific keywords. So keyword selection in Japanese is not always straightforward and from an SEO point of view, you really want to know what keyword will provide the best ROI and often it may not be the normal term given by translation. It is therefore very important when doing SEO in Japanese to be confident in the Japanese language skills of your translators and always ask them about abbreviations and colloquialisms for the particular keywords you are targeting.For any foreigner thinking to expand or create a website targeting Japan and writing Japanese content, I will say it again “Are you choosing the right keyword?”Tags: Japan, Keyword Research, Keyword Selection, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO Japan','article'),(4782,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/seo-japan/are-you-choosing-the-right-keyword-for-your-japanese-seo/feed','','','','','others'),(4784,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/ppc-china/big-ecommerce-brands-are-leaving-baidu/attachment/360buyinterface/','360buyInterface','','','Category: ','article'),(4785,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/how-to-submit-your-resources-to-baidu-search-open-platform/attachment/baidu-search-open-platform-7/','Baidu Search Open Platform 7','','','Category: ','article'),(4786,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/how-to-submit-your-resources-to-baidu-search-open-platform/attachment/baidu-search-open-platform-8/','Baidu Search Open Platform 8','','','Category: ','article'),(4787,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/social-media-japan/facebook-vs-mixi-in-japan-for-social-media-marketing/attachment/facebook-japan-logo/','facebook-japan-logo','','','Category: ','article'),(4788,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/social-media-japan/facebook-vs-mixi-in-japan-for-social-media-marketing/attachment/mixi_logo/','mixi_logo','','','Category: ','article'),(4789,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/social-media-japan/facebook-vs-mixi-in-japan-for-social-media-marketing/trackback/','Facebook vs Mixi in Japan for Social Media Marketing','','An analysis of two of the players in the social media landscape in Japan - Facebook and Mixi - and viewpoints on corporate social media marketing for these platforms...','With the speed with which the internet continues to evolve, it is impossible to neglect its influence, particularly that of Social Media, which has been one of the hottest topics around the globe thanks to the rapid rise and power of “Facebook”. Many companies promote their businesses in social network websites and by doing this; solve the “one click away” strategy for users to see what the newest promotion is or what the latest products are.In Japan, Mixi.jp is still the leading social network website with more than 21 million users, compared to around 2 million users in Japan for Facebook. However, Facebook is catching up and I believe, with its fan page functionalities, is more suitable for corporate social media marketing.For Digital Marketers in Japan it is, as everywhere else, important to focus on social media to get the message out to potential customers and to engage with them and existing customers. The following is a comparison for Facebook and Mixi in Japan.Japan has traditionally had a unique online culture where people tend to keep their privacy and feel insecure disclosing their personal information online. That is one reason why Facebook first struggled in the market as their rule is to have your real name posted. Mixi however allows users to use their nick name instead. Mixi also has a functionality whereby people can check who has visited their profile as people tend to like to know who has visited their page.However, the whole model is experiencing a gradual shift. Facebook users in Japan are growing rapidly – there has been an approximately 21% increase in users from January to February this year already.Especially from a corporate point of view, many Japanese companies are starting to make fan pages on Facebook realizing that they can brand their company and reach out to millions of potential customers. At the end of the day, users want emgagement with companies in a friendly manner and companies want reviews and likes from customers to further improve.Facebook’s growing presence in Japan is also a good search engine optimization opportunity for companies in Japan and international companies wishing to expand their presence in Japan as search engines are beginning to or will eventually incorporate Facebook “likes” into ranking algorithms. Facebook is still growing in Japan, with the recent movie “Social Network” attracting even more users.Although Mixi is still the dominant social media platform in Japan, Facebook, with features such as fan pages and other unique features it provides, is definitely becoming more important for many corporate marketers in Japan and I do believe with the user growth trends being experienced, it may be just a matter of time before Facebook makes further inroads into Mixi’s dominance.Facebook is free anyway, so if you want to target Japan, it is important to customize a fan page in Japanese on the Facebook Japan site.Stats Source from: Neilson and SocialBakers.Tags: Facebook, Japan, Mixi, Social MediaCategory: Social, Social Media Japan','article'),(4790,'http://www.searchblog.asia/japan/social-media-japan/facebook-vs-mixi-in-japan-for-social-media-marketing/feed','','','','','others'),(4793,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-a-new-seo-tool-in-china-baidu-search-open-platform/attachment/baidu-search-open-platform/','Baidu Search Open Platform','','','Category: ','article'),(4794,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-a-new-seo-tool-in-china-baidu-search-open-platform/attachment/baidu-search-open-platform-2-2/','Baidu Search Open Platform 2','','','Category: ','article'),(4795,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-a-new-seo-tool-in-china-baidu-search-open-platform/attachment/baidu-search-open-platform-3-2/','Baidu Search Open Platform 3','','','Category: ','article'),(4796,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-a-new-seo-tool-in-china-baidu-search-open-platform/attachment/baidu-search-open-platform-4/','Baidu Search Open Platform 4','','','Category: ','article'),(4797,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-a-new-seo-tool-in-china-baidu-search-open-platform/attachment/baidu-search-open-platform-5/','Baidu Search Open Platform 5','','','Category: ','article'),(4798,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-a-new-seo-tool-in-china-baidu-search-open-platform/attachment/baidu-search-open-platform-6/','Baidu Search Open Platform 6','','','Category: ','article'),(4799,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-whats-the-impact-that-google-instant-or-instant-search-brings-to-china/attachment/google-instant/','Google Instant in China','','','Category: ','article'),(4800,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/seo-china-whats-the-impact-that-google-instant-or-instant-search-brings-to-china/attachment/baidu-ppc-phoenix-nest/','Baidu PPC Phoenix Nest','','','Category: ','article'),(4801,'http://www.searchblog.asia/the-challenge-to-the-google-yahoo-japan-partnership-%E2%80%93-part-2','404 Not Found','','',' Not Found The requested document was not found on this server.

This blog provides two different examples and how SEO can be used to protect brand reputations...','Over the past few months, two companies contacted us with online reputation problems in China. One was in hospitality and the other was a prominent technology company. Their issues were in fact the same. When conducting searches for their brand and product terms, negative comments in bulletin board systems (BBS) in China were showing up on page one of both Google China and Baidu. For many terms, this content ranked above their own website. They understandably felt this was impacting their sales during the consideration phase of a customer’s purchase and accordingly were wondering whether some kind of Chinese SEO or Social Media reputation management strategy might be able to help them.Did They Deserve It?When doing online reputation management we think knowing if the client actually deserves what they get and assessing how serious the charges are is an important first step in deciding if you want the business or not. Both of these clients pleaded innocent. The hospitality company contested it had been “misunderstood” and for every negative comment found on a BBS, it could produce a gleaming testimonial. The technology company believed it was under attack from a competitor.The Hospitality CompanyAfter receiving a phone call from the company, we investigated its problem to see if we could help. Although we have not heard of the company before, its website looked impressive with a number of locations and medium to high-end properties.After initial investigations we found that the dissatisfaction with this company was widespread and was fragmented across scores of travel blogs and the bulletin board systems all highlighting a negative experience with the company.The deeper we went, the worse it got. Quite incredibly, whilst on holiday, people were approached and lured into tours of resorts with the promise of prizes. They were given “winning tickets” and then told in order to redeem the prize, they would have to come to the resort to collect it. Once they arrived at the resort they were taken on a tour and were told the prize would be given to them later. During the initial tour all was well. But after what they thought was the end (with their defences down) a pushy sales person would appear who would try to sell further holidays or a timeshare. In many cases people were kept for up to five hours until they surrendered or otherwise found another way to escape!After discussion with company executives about their business practices, it became clear they had no intention of changing their approach. Although the company could see that the negative search engine results were impacting its business, the executives simply wanted us to make the negative comments go away. Without any change, the company would be continually plugging the gaps as more negative content appeared. This was not the client for us!The Technology CompanyIn contrast, the technology company’s problems, while the same in nature, were for different causes. After some digging, we isolated the root cause of the problem coming from three articles written by a moderately prominent blogger in China’s technology sector. The technology company in question was a large and very well known company that has spent years building a solid reputation through the provision of world leading products. In each case the blogger highlighted problems about the company and its products and suggested any Chinese company using the product was stupid. The articles were duplicated in various forms and distributed through China’s online technology forums . It was our conclusion that the client was undeserving of such an attack and any plan to protect its reputation was justified.Managing Reputation in China – Top TipsFinally, using SEO as an ongoing process to promote both positive PR articles and content from blogs and bulletin boards can be a smart defensive strategy to protect your brand and dominate page one results on Baidu and Google in China.Tags: Baidu, BBS Bulletin Board Systems, China, Google, Google China, Reputation Management, SEOCategory: SEO, SEO China','article'),(4805,'http://www.searchblog.asia/china/seo-china/managing-your-brand-terms-on-baidu-and-google-china/feed','','','','','others'),(4807,'http://www.searchblog.asia/tag/baidu/page/6/','Baidu - 6/10 - Search Blog Asia - SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand...  : Search Blog Asia – SEO Insights for China, Japan, Korea, Thailand…','','',' China Search Social Integration – Baidu and Soso Index Microblog Content Not long ago, Sina Weibo launched Real-time Search.

When you type any search term in the box, it shows an enhanced version of Baidu search suggest. Actually, it’s more like a Baidu version of instant search technology.As you can see from the picture above, a result box next to the search suggest shows the top three organic results. People can click on those results and go to the result web page even without pressing the search button. Like Google instant search, the result will change as you are typing. Besides, you can actually roll your mouse over to the suggested terms and see the search result for that term as well.I have not found any news and stats about this new feature yet on the Internet, and I guess Baidu is still testing it. However, without a doubt, this is a good feature for SEOers. One of the biggest controversies on if it’s worth doing SEO for Baidu is because of too many PPC ads showing above the natural search results.
